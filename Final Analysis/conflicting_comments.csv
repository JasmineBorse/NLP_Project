"i believe that somehow if we managed to keep the current co2 level stable, that is around 420 ppm or so; the momentum of change we have already made would continue to stabilize the climate to the point where passing several tipping point is inevitable. the death toll from these change will almost certainly amount to about 1/2 of the world population and, even worse, a reduction in the planet's carrying capacity to no more than about 2 billion people. this will transform our current civilization to the point where the standard of living for most individual will crash and kill off 90% of many countries. coupled with the kind of demographic change already occurring in nearly all developed countries, we should expect to see a peak population during the next 10 year followed by a rapid decline. these change are pretty well baked in right now. on the other hand those people predicting the end of the human race because of these change are being silly. the more the population shrinks, the le impact people will have on the environment. unless the planet becomes a snowball earth like that happened several hundred million year ago, there will always be a large area of the planet capable of sustaining a sizeable population. the problem really is that a lot of people will either lose their life or their ability to sustain themselves comfortably. the amount of suffering will be incalculable while the cost of cleaning up the mess becomes unsustainable. by making ludicrous investment today, many, if not most, of these future change can be avoided. that should really be the debate. is it worth a trillion dollar a year to ensure this suffering doesn't occur? we spend that much on making war so the money is available. it seems to me that making our life better should be more important but that is just me.",Negative,Positive,Positive

"𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗚𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗱 a few day ago, the paper warned that europe is facing the worst drought in 500 years. they described the dry and hot weather and the fire that broke out all over the continent and spoke of an apocalypse. today, they are reporting flooding in london and violent storm in france causing catastrophic flooding, where in some places, more than an inch of rain fell in le than 30 minutes, and in paris, a storm with 65 mph wind gust and nearly 2 inch of rain that fell in just 90 minute flooded the metro. clearly, the climate ha gone mad. however, the climate did not go awry by itself, but because of our madness. nature’s erratic behavior merely reflects our own agitation toward everything. our growing narcissism drive u to treat everyone and everything with utter indifference to the need of others. in fact, we even enjoy hurting others. we think that if we can use others and not see the consequence for our action right away then there are no consequences, but there are very serious consequence for our wrongdoing toward others. in the closed system that is the world we live in, everything we do affect everything else, and that effect return to u like a boomerang. when we pour so much negativity into the system, it becomes dysfunctional, and this summer, we are experiencing this dysfunction through the smoldering heat wave and torrential rains. if we continue to flood the system with hatred and intolerance, we will not need nuclear weapon to wipe u out; plague, natural disasters, fires, and flood will extinguish u long before we extinguish each other. when the summer is gone, winter will come with it own perils, and lack of gas and power will break havoc in europe. eventually, we will have to accept that we cannot defeat nature; we cannot outsmart it. we will have to learn to be an integral part of nature, connected to each other and to nature. we will not survive otherwise. since the only element in nature that ha bad intention and an exploitation attitude toward others is us, we must begin to change our relationships. our attitude toward the rest of nature stem from our attitude toward each other. therefore, if we are considerable toward each other, we will be considerable toward nature. it turn out that the correction of our tormented planet begin with the correction of our broken tie with one another. to mend them, we must put our head together and discus solution on a global level. these solution must be inclusive and take into account everyone's needs. at the same time, everyone must accept that they cannot receive more than is necessary, since they, too, must be considerable toward others. to get such a global initiative off the ground, there need to be an open discussion about it all over the global media. people must know that we really are running out of time, and unless we ‎ change now, it will be too late afterwards.‎ i do not know how to keep this move clean from politics and politicians, but it ha to be a ‎genuine effort to save humanity and the planet, not a ploy to take control of it. perhaps a panel of scientist will be able to make this happen, but they, too, must work without ulterior motives.‎ i realize that this idea may sound naive, but i also realize that if we do not take global action to sincerely improve our connections, the approaching annihilation is certain and near.‎",Negative,Positive,Positive

(leap of faith from a small sample). then there is mars...?? the elephant in the room. we are just supposed to take him at his word that the milankovitch cycle are simply too insignificant to make a difference a they did in the past ice ages. the biggest mistake the narrator make is his assumption of the people who question this new climate science, are science deniers. instead it is clearly a rush to judgement by him based on assumption. lest we forget the dinner party rush to judgement to take the cutoff that sealed their fate. i'm not saying that all argument he presented are lacking facts. i'm just suggesting that the basis of science is to question everything. included are past accepted theories. newton's theory of gravity wa overturned by einstein's... instead of making insinuations, continue with the evidence. science will be able to stand up on it own.",Negative,Positive,Positive

it’s completely stupid to claim that ice-ages isn’t a natural occurrence due to fluctuation of both gas and the positioning of the earth around the sun… climate change also happens with involvement of the moon and the tide of the oceans. if you think this guy is actually smart enough to promote politically motivated changes. science doesn’t agree with what joe or you claiming. we already made calculation and scientific study of factories in people and the actual vehicle and factory and everything human touch. scientist calculated the amount of metric ton of gas every year. we even calculated such estimate from a far back a the 1700s. meanwhile scientist proven human involvement ha very little to will in effect on the environment what’s happening is more of a cycle that been happening and like most calculation we haven’t studied all the correlation of all the pattern occurring in history. the guy claiming that it’s like economics or triple down economic effect is absolutely wrong. you can make a broad claim of that such degree is dishonest. he doesn’t mention any metric no pictogram and no form of average on the situation. volcano on surface level do cause cooling but with straight short period that can last around 2 decade of heat and over 75+% of volcano are under water which actually cause the opposite of the effect of volcano on the surface. also claiming that human admit more carbon admission than volcano is factually just wrong scientist study actually prove the opposite.,Positive,Negative,Negative

"this video wa very irresponsible and the historical analysis is so one-dimensional and incorrect. and i suspect the sponsor are involved in the final message of blaming china. any correct and decent historical analysis would include colonialism, u imperialism, and the global supply chain. for instance, the united state ha over 800 military base all over the world to 1) maintain access to the resource and raw material it need for the production of it goods, therefore, to build it wealth, and 2) to protect u investment and productive force that produce for u business abroad. so real and historically correct analysis should include question like how many of these countries' emission are a direct result of historical and ongoing colonialism or historical and ongoing military intervention that keep country producing good that are made for western businesses? the west polices, threatens, and force these country to produce their good and to maintain access to their raw materials. you cannot blame country for their emission if they are forced to emit them under threat of a gun, and moreover, i'd even argue that they shouldn't even be counted a emission by those countries, and should be counted under the country for which they are producing their goods. so more accurately, the question should be, ""how much do these country and their militarily imposed business interest abroad emit? why wa china able to industrialized and become the world largest producer of goods, which made them the #1 polluted? their factory and manufacturing economy didn't just pop up out of nowhere. seriously, what country are they producing good for? you analysis is one dimensional because chinese factory are largely given raw material from african and latin american country that are forced by western military to keep the raw material flowing outward--which the process of mining and refining these raw material are likely counted in your number under the country from which they come, and not counted under the country that force this production. then once these good reach china, they are made for western business and western demand in general. this video is borderline red baiting and completely whitewashing of history and you should be ashamed for releasing something so obviously in line with the type of thinking that only benefit the u state department and the west in general by solving them of their historical and ongoing crime of colonialism, militarily, and slavery and other form of forced labor!",Negative,Positive,Positive

"i could say this until i’m blue in the face but the climate alarming will not believe me or call me a climate denier whatever the hell that mean laugh out loud how can you deny something that very clearly exists, that’s like saying you deny that air exists lol.. the reason why government all over the world especially government of coastal country and island but the reason why they’re not doing a damn thing about radically reducing co2 emission is because none of them really believe it, if government of the world honestly believed even half of the catastrophe that people are calling for then the rich and powerful, world leaders, people like al gore and michael moore etc! they would not be buying up property and building house on the coast. instead they are actually profiling from it! campaigning on it, flying all of the world and using it to push their agenda, pushing climate change ha become a billion dollar industry and is good politically for government all over the world with various carbon tax and subsidy for the solar industry, it’s used to influence and change society on a global scale! if they actually believed these thing would happen they would be doing something about it in their own life at least! note i am afraid to tell you that people who believe this climate catastrophe mass extinction, global starvation and drought, the planet will be underwater in the next decade or two, billion of people will die blah blah blah! these very same people have been saying this for more than 50 year now and absolutely none of their prediction we’re even close! a a matter of fact rising co2 level and rising global temperature ha had the opposite effect! country all around the world are producing more food than they ever have! more than a billion people throughout the world have risen out of poverty in the last few decades! we have been producing far more food then we even need, many of these first and second world country have an obesity problem! the scientific community when it come to global climate measure thing not on the scale of year or decade but in hundred of year and thousand of year so just because temperature have risen 1-2 degree in the past century mean absolutely nothing, yes global temperature are rising but they have also been rising since the end of the last ice age, water level may have risen in some part of the world but they have also gone dow water level may have risen in some part of the world but in other part of the world water level have gone down.. when i hear people breaking out over co2 level and believing that we have caused irreversible damage to our planet climate so our child and grandchild will do not have a future, it drive me crazy because that is just flat out wrong! human activity only contributes about 3% of the total annual co2 level added into our atmosphere every year! fucking 3%! so when they talk about co2 being the driving force of climate change, well no shit sherlock co2 is carbon dioxide and everything in the world, everything we’ve ever known in the sky above to the dirt below, you me, plant animal everything is made of carbon, literally everything because we are a carbon-based species and planet.. pumping more co2 into the atmosphere if anything would be a good thing because co2 is basically plant food, plant absorb co2 during the day and release oxygen a a byproduct, this is called photosynthesis.. basically what i’m trying to say is to not believe this ridiculous extinction level nonsense because i promise you earth climate is not going to turn on us, we have period where earth climate is very stable and we have hot period and we have cold period while some area and country receive lot of rain while other area receive little i mean we don’t have a static climate. there’s a handful of thing that can drastically alter earth climate such a solar activity and volcanic activity and a substantial magnetic shift of earth poles, an asteroid impact etc... co2 level rising is not going to do a damn thing because our atmosphere is only 0.04% co2, 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 0.93% argon and various other lighter gases. if anything a rise in co2 would coincide with a rise in oxygen so that would actually be a good thing.. i’m not saying we should polluted our planet, we should absolutely take good care of it and clean it up but hearing video like this just tell me that this person is naïve a hell",Negative,Positive,Positive

"what is the cause of climate change and how can it be solved? many people think that the cause of climate change is carbon dioxide, and reducing carbon dioxide can prevent climate change. this is a bit convincing, but not correct. the exact cause of climate change is ""thermal excess"" on the earth. therefore, to stop climate change, we must focus on stopping of the ""thermal excess"". ""green new deal"" ha good intentions. however, there are several problems. the biggest problem is that it is le economical. it mean that it is difficult for many people to actively participate. therefore, coercion must be mobilized to achieve the desired goal, and excessive coercion hinder the achievement of the goal. this is a fundamental problem. also, waste is another problem. waste solar cell and waste blade are discharged, and the waste battery of es adversely affect the environment. although there is a problem with the need for large land, the best way to reduce heat and carbon dioxide is to create big forests. trump should publicize the effect of ""one trillion trees"" to others and urge the world to join in and work together. why is ""one trillion trees"" so effective? first of all, it is economical. compared to solar power generation and wind power generation, it doe not require a lot of fund at the beginning. forest ha a long lifespan, and doe not require additional facility such a es and power transmission and distribution facilities, and doe not emit waste. in addition, one trillion tree absorb enormous amount of solar heat. photosynthesis requires infrared ray from the sun. it absorbs infrared ray (heat rays) and ultraviolet ray to perform photosynthesis, turning carbon dioxide into oxygen and making glucose. one trillion tree absorbing solar heat is very good at slowing down climate change. the reason people don't really care about tree absorbing heat is that they don't think the cause of global warming is fundamentally ""overheating,"" but rather carbon dioxide. how can you get a lot of land? we have to use the desert. but how to supply a huge amount of water? this is a solution --> @. if you like the movie, leave a comment.",Negative,Positive,Positive

"cape town almost running out of water, wa not caused by a unique or new event. the area ha for millennia often suffered from a few year of drought, followed by an exceptional good rain season, after which thing normalized. the water crisis in cape town ha been caused by a combination of neglect if maintenance and expansion of infrastructure by the national government, run by the anc, a wel a mismanagement of the water stock in the reservoir or dam feeding cape town, by the western cape provincial government and the cape town municipal government, both run by the da government. when the anc took over government in 1994, sa had reserve electricity and construction of more dam were planned to provide for the shortage experienced in many part of the country during drought periods. since 1994, sa's population ha doubled, mostly thanks to illegal immigration from all over africa by people fleeing war and dictatorship, looking for a brighter future and the anc ha practically been connecting the ever increasing population to the existing electricity and water supply but ha stopped maintenance on existing infrastructure and planned expansion there of wa halted. no new dam were built and soon the power station were not able to produce the amount of electricity they were supposed too, leading to large industry leaving sa and million of people becoming unemployed. a water pipe were not replaced at the end of their life time, an ever growing percentage of water simply leaked out before it reached the consumers. burst pipe in suburbs, causing thousand of kilometer to run down street into storm water drains, became the order of the day. course the expanding population connecting to a declining supply would eventually lead to a crisis. the da which won local government and municipal election in the western cape and in the city of cape town, is responsible to manage the reservoir in the province and the city, but after the water crisis have already existing, not only they allowed more water to farmer than their quota while, citizen of cape town were constantly being scored for not saving enough and the mayor did house visit with tv camera to shame alleged perpetrators, but slice and valve of various dam were opened, letting valuable stored fresh water run out into the see. a day zero approached, and resident were allowed to spend no more than 4 minute in the shower per day, using a bucket to catch whatever water they can to use in the toilet, the city dragged it foot negotiating over priced contract to construct badly placed deceleration plant with capacity which would be a drop in a bucket of the demand. a citizen started uncovered all of this and were getting ready to que daily with bucket to collect water from tanker which were planned to transport water into the city, suddenly water wa released from a reservoir up stream, owned by farmer who receiver good rain and shortly after, the drought ended with a la nina event, filling all the dam within one season, just in time not only for cape town, but for many city and town across south africa which were approaching the same crisis. so, don't be ridiculous and blame the climate. water is a valuable commodity in sa and need to be conserved, but we have always had drought before and we will continue to have them. if infrastructure is not maintained and expanded in line with demand, you will eventually run dry. this time the rain came in time, but soon enough the next drought will come around. in the meantime, the population is growing, infrastructure is not expanded and the same people are in charge of managing the resources. can someone see a disaster coming and doe the climate have anything to do with it?",Negative,Positive,Positive

"if greenhouse gas actually are the reason for why our climate is warm, and warming, then why would a 47% increase in co2 only result in 1°c? that's right. from 280ppm, to 414ppm, only 1°c. in other words, from 0.028% of the atmosphere, to 0.041%. that's clearly far le than 1%. it's actually about 1/25 of 1%. the actual increase over the course of the entire industrial revolution is about 0.01%, or 1/100 of 1%. if you actually believe climate change, you are out of touch with reality, and lacking in common sense. the problem with fossil fuel is how energy dense they are, in proportion to how much energy is actually converted into kinetic energy. a tiny amount of co2 and h2o emission actually result in a tremendous amount of energy, and most of it is wasted a heat, ~70%. that mean 7/10 gallon of gasoline is just/only wasted heat, being pumped into the local environment. considering how much hotter the ground level atmosphere naturally is, because of the atmospheric pressure, and the fact that almost all the heat being wasted is around ground level, it's safe to say that it effect the ""atmosphere"" a lot. this notion that only co2 somehow trap heat is ludicrous. the entire atmosphere trap heat. overtime it absorbs energy and get hot, it ""traps"" heat. while co2 can literally hold more energy than o2, it also take more energy to get hot. the only time it appears to be a greenhouse gas is when you ignore the mass of the gas itself, and it's greater density cause it to build pressure within a container far more quickly. there's a reason why cooking in the oven at 350°f doesn't cook a fast a boiling water. it's the same reason why a pot of water boil faster with the lid on. it's because of pressure. more mass = more pressure. co2 is a denser gas, and so it build pressure much faster than normal air. in the environment, not only is there not enough co2 for it to actually matter, there's no way for it to build pressure in an exclusive way (the co2 is just a hot a everything else) because there's no lid or segregation. it's very well mixed in, constituting 0.04% of the total. i'm sick of climate change.",Negative,Positive,Positive

"1. a 15-year-old individual, influenced by climate activist great thunder, approached the narrator at a party with concern about carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere. this person expressed a belief that carbon dioxide constituted over half of the earth's atmosphere and feared suffocation or death from a heatwave before the age of 35. 2. the individual held a conviction that the high level of carbon dioxide wa problematic and that it wa a direct result of the older generations' actions. 3. in an attempt to provide accurate information and perspective, the narrator used a graphical representation similar to those used for covid data to illustrate the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 4. the visual representation consisted of a large green square (representing the entire atmosphere) and a much smaller red square (representing carbon dioxide), which showed carbon dioxide a one part of every 2,500 part of the atmosphere. 5. this graphical method faced opposition from some who were surprised or upset by the depiction, linking the reaction to religious offence taken at depiction of sacred figures. 6. the measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide ha been taken accurately for 60 year at the fauna loa observatory in hawaii, near a volcano. 7. over this 60-year period, carbon dioxide level have increased from 320 part per million (ppm) to 420 ppm, indicating a rise but still showing carbon dioxide a a minor component of the atmosphere, emphasizing it proportion rather than it properties.",Negative,Positive,Positive

"the solution is to requester all the carbon that we have released in the stock of living biomass (as it is presently accumulating in the atmosphere and in the ocean precisely because we are not doing so). however, conservation/preservation, a currently practiced, is not the answer for two reasons first, it doe nothing to change the lifestyle of most humans. you can’t have conservation here and business a usual everywhere else. everything is connected to everything so unless we remove polluting, habitat destructive & appropriation industry and human activity from the surface of the planet (and preferably place them in outer space) and simultaneously create an ecologically literate population and an ecological-based and ecologically-constrained technology and economy, what little good conservation effort produce will be of little help. conservation make people feel good to think that some “wild” area are being preserved. but this is simply untrue and promoting this lie a true is thus counterproductive. second, what we currently view and seek to conserve a “pristine wilderness” is actually highly degraded land that wa slowly recovering from the extinction associated with pleistocene climate change and wa then set back and made substantially worse by the process and demand of agricultural and industrial human civilization. thus ecological restoration and enhancement of ecosystem to pre-pleistocene universities, abundance and functional capacities, rather than preservation of degraded ecosystems, ought to be the goal. furthermore, the gene of the descendant of species that lived during the warmer period of the scene are a key part of the solution. they should be closely examined and sequenced a gene may be found that can help wild species to adapt to a rapidly warming climate. wild species (and in many area domesticated livestock) cannot simply run into an air conditioned space to ride out an area-wide heat wave. without habitat enhancement, migration corridor and migration assistance and likely genetic engineering, death and further extinction and ecosystem collapse are likely if not inevitable outcomes.",Negative,Positive,Positive
"being against research seems shortsigtened. when we look at the model we see it doe notmagically stop at 2-3 k warming that is the warming with a doubling of co2. but we are not heading at all to that 560 ppm mark, we are heading for much more.also we do not know what tipping are to be expected with 2k or 3k warming or even less.... also if climate is more sensitive or if model underestimate the warming (there are model that predict a lot more warming) we could go up to well over 3k warming or even 5k. so what could be happening is really extreme the loss of the tag forest in canada and even worse russia (much bigger), loss of reefs, loss of icesheets with 3-7 m sublevel rise an din short a global extinction comparable to the persian one. the problem is not co2 in itself (it is when it come to ocean acidification) but the temperatures. the heat. of course co2 is at it basis, but in itself co2 is pretty benign. it effect in our atmosphere are not. and countering that side-effects and lowering temperature could halt that extinction event. another problem the longer we wait the more drastic cooling might be needed to stop process that really only can be halted with a return to pre industrial levels. so if we need to use it a an emergency, it could well be that that drastic breaking is not without it unwanted side effects. with so many unknowns, with a world in 2023 not stepping on any break when it come to curling down co2 emission in spite of consequence seeing all around us, we are heading for a warming that is so disastrous we need to curb this warming trend sooner, not later and we need to research the best possible way to do so. i hear people talking about a moral hazard. what moral hazard when we look around u at least in my view what morals? isn't it striking that in time of enivornmetal problem causing all sort of damage it are fighting party everywhere that are winning, not losing? look at trump who is at it soon again or someone of his ilk, look in europe. there is globally a political unwillingness to tackle the emissions. there are no moral when it come to co2 emission so never mind a moral hazard when it come to research. do mind abuse of technology by those very same people who can and will use technology that is not well researched when consequence of their own inability to act on the fundamental problem put them in dire strait (locally). there are no good reason at all not to research this and blurring out claim by scientist on this topic without good research is rather scientific and therefore more emotional. i would like to note that in my view much of those who are against research do not seem to live in country like tuvalu, pakistan, indian where in various way people face existential threat already due to the warming. it seems we can say this a long a we in the north do not suffer similar consequences. but once we do and this will be sooner than later, see how opinion of those that matter changes... my take is that we need to research it a soon a possible and if it is benign, we should also use it sooner not later. because the worse the warming gets, the harder we need to step on the break which itself could be a true shock for nature.",Negative,Positive,Positive

(b) our plant are loving it because they evolved to eat much higher level of co2 than we have now (we pump it in at 1000 ppm to greenhouse because that's what they like). (c) co2 level have been much higher in the past (2,000 ppm when brachiosaurus wa stopping about) and the world survived. it wa at 7,000 ppm when our fossil fuel were laid down. how about the nota's own ice core sample that show we go through period of warming and cooling, and peak warming every 100,000 year or so (we're just over 100,000 year since the last one)? how doe he justify plugging the west, responsible for le than 50% of co2 emission (which are greeting the planet. china and asia, plus developing country being helped by china, account for over 50%) into economic disaster, with it associated starvation, suicides, riot and revolution over something that happens regularly, and that we cannot stop even if it wa our fault because the biggest 'polluted' won't play ball (india call it eco-colonialism. frankly, i'm with them). is the temp rising? yes. it doe that. every 100,000 year or so, it go very high. then it drop down to around -3 to -4. the last one (just over 100,000 year ago) wa the remain. 100,000 year before that we had la bought, 100,000 before that purfleet, and 100,000 before that the hoxnian. it happens, it's predictable. we need to focus not on stopping it, but on stealing ourselves to deal with it because even if we stopped (everyone, including china, asia, etc) producing co2 tomorrow, the temp with still go up. we also need to find a reliable power source that can work in subvert temps, because that's what come next. wind and solar will not cut it. co2 is 0.04% of the 1% of gigs. of that over 96% is entirely natural (plants and animal breathing, evaporation from the oceans, volcanic activity, etc). man is responsible for le than 4% of 0.04% of 1%. if the earth were so sensitive that it would burn up if we carry on, it would have burned to a crisp when krakatoa went boom in 1882. it didn't. the earth can cope. it is coping by growing more plant (which are feeding the people, so win-win). bottom line. the threat to the farmer (fire told they must slaughter 200,000 cattle, farmer across europe told they must stop growing food, stop using fertilizer and generally stop running efficient farms) ha led to outcry because we all know that if they stop, we starve. they're telling u to get rid of our car and shift to electric, but the grid couldn't cope if we could do that, and most of u are too broke thanks to the cost of heating and fuel right now. we're poor and we're starting to get very, very angry. most of the alarming stuff is coming from one model, cp 8.5. they put figure we know from 50 year ago into cp 8.5 and asked it to tell u the weather today. we're all, apparently, dead. of all the models, cp 2.4 (i think) is the lowest and most accurately aligns with reality, but it's not scary, so they don't use it for the press briefings. there's only so long you can keep cry wolf. stop funding this idiot and you'd be amazed how fast the fearmongering go down. i've seen paper on how diabetes is responsible for the obesity epidemic (as opposed to stupid amount of cheap sugar in the food and sedentary lifestyles) and diabetes. say anything is caused by climate change, and you'll get published, even if it's utter rubbish. this ha got to stop. use the trillion being pushed into this into defence against rising sea levels, research into genuine alternative to fossil fuel (which will run out one day, and we need something we can turn on and off to accommodate peak in demands. you can't do that with a nuclear power station!), and way to keep people cool because we're going to need it, but stop saying we're going to turn into venus. we simply won't. we're not close enough to the sun, we have much more water than that planet ever had, and earth ha been through this many time before.",Negative,Positive,Positive
