"so the un sg doesn't read his own un-funded ipcc reports. this is what ipcc ar6 chapter 11 on extreme weather say about the weather. these are direct quotes. on floods “low confidence for observed change in the magnitude or frequency of flood at the global scale.” on droughts “there is medium confidence that since the 1950s some region of the world have experienced a trend to more intense and longer drought … but in some region drought have become le frequent, le intense, or shorter…”. [thus, no global trend in droughts, but an increase in some region and a decrease in others.] hurricanes/tropical cyclones ”there is low confidence in observed long-term trend in hurricane intensity, frequency, and duration, and any observed trend in phenomenon such a tornado and hail.” “data corresponding to hurricane that have directly impacted the united state since 1900 are considered to be reliable, and show no trend in the frequency of u.s. landfall events” “data representing hurricane landfall frequency over australia show a decreasing trend in eastern australia since the 1800s a well a in other part of australia since 1982.” extra tropical storm [ie. major storm outside of the tropics]. “there is overall low confidence in recent change in the total number of storm over both hemispheres” “overall, there is also low confidence in past-century trend in the number and intensity of the strongest storms” so where, in that, is there evidence that ""climate change is out of control""? it's interesting and disappointing that the guardian prefers to quote the mis-informed non-expert who doesn't even read his own organisation's report (except of course the summary by policymakers) rather than do it own 'investigative journalism' of actually reading what the 'consensus science' says. it would be the equivalent for the supposed exon scam of 'already knowing about climate change' a if the guardian only quoted the ceo and ignored any other evidence. would they do that? of course not. their action and investigative effort are driven by the agenda they want to present rather than the truth.",Positive

"i believe that somehow if we managed to keep the current co2 level stable, that is around 420 ppm or so; the momentum of change we have already made would continue to stabilize the climate to the point where passing several tipping point is inevitable. the death toll from these change will almost certainly amount to about 1/2 of the world population and, even worse, a reduction in the planet's carrying capacity to no more than about 2 billion people. this will transform our current civilization to the point where the standard of living for most individual will crash and kill off 90% of many countries. coupled with the kind of demographic change already occurring in nearly all developed countries, we should expect to see a peak population during the next 10 year followed by a rapid decline. these change are pretty well baked in right now. on the other hand those people predicting the end of the human race because of these change are being silly. the more the population shrinks, the le impact people will have on the environment. unless the planet becomes a snowball earth like that happened several hundred million year ago, there will always be a large area of the planet capable of sustaining a sizeable population. the problem really is that a lot of people will either lose their life or their ability to sustain themselves comfortably. the amount of suffering will be incalculable while the cost of cleaning up the mess becomes unsustainable. by making ludicrous investment today, many, if not most, of these future change can be avoided. that should really be the debate. is it worth a trillion dollar a year to ensure this suffering doesn't occur? we spend that much on making war so the money is available. it seems to me that making our life better should be more important but that is just me.",Negative

"𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗚𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗱 a few day ago, the paper warned that europe is facing the worst drought in 500 years. they described the dry and hot weather and the fire that broke out all over the continent and spoke of an apocalypse. today, they are reporting flooding in london and violent storm in france causing catastrophic flooding, where in some places, more than an inch of rain fell in le than 30 minutes, and in paris, a storm with 65 mph wind gust and nearly 2 inch of rain that fell in just 90 minute flooded the metro. clearly, the climate ha gone mad. however, the climate did not go awry by itself, but because of our madness. nature’s erratic behavior merely reflects our own agitation toward everything. our growing narcissism drive u to treat everyone and everything with utter indifference to the need of others. in fact, we even enjoy hurting others. we think that if we can use others and not see the consequence for our action right away then there are no consequences, but there are very serious consequence for our wrongdoing toward others. in the closed system that is the world we live in, everything we do affect everything else, and that effect return to u like a boomerang. when we pour so much negativity into the system, it becomes dysfunctional, and this summer, we are experiencing this dysfunction through the smoldering heat wave and torrential rains. if we continue to flood the system with hatred and intolerance, we will not need nuclear weapon to wipe u out; plague, natural disasters, fires, and flood will extinguish u long before we extinguish each other. when the summer is gone, winter will come with it own perils, and lack of gas and power will break havoc in europe. eventually, we will have to accept that we cannot defeat nature; we cannot outsmart it. we will have to learn to be an integral part of nature, connected to each other and to nature. we will not survive otherwise. since the only element in nature that ha bad intention and an exploitation attitude toward others is us, we must begin to change our relationships. our attitude toward the rest of nature stem from our attitude toward each other. therefore, if we are considerable toward each other, we will be considerable toward nature. it turn out that the correction of our tormented planet begin with the correction of our broken tie with one another. to mend them, we must put our head together and discus solution on a global level. these solution must be inclusive and take into account everyone's needs. at the same time, everyone must accept that they cannot receive more than is necessary, since they, too, must be considerable toward others. to get such a global initiative off the ground, there need to be an open discussion about it all over the global media. people must know that we really are running out of time, and unless we ‎ change now, it will be too late afterwards.‎ i do not know how to keep this move clean from politics and politicians, but it ha to be a ‎genuine effort to save humanity and the planet, not a ploy to take control of it. perhaps a panel of scientist will be able to make this happen, but they, too, must work without ulterior motives.‎ i realize that this idea may sound naive, but i also realize that if we do not take global action to sincerely improve our connections, the approaching annihilation is certain and near.‎",Negative

"actually, blaming the climate change on our activity is just another form of human arrogance, in believing that we are god-like beings, with total control over our planet, but, bear this in mind. hundred of million of year ago, the earth wa cover by water. fish were the dominant species. then, the climate changed, there wa smaller ocean & more land, it wa warm & humid, with forests of fern & horsetails. amphibian evolved. then the climate changed dramatically ,turning the land into hot, dry deserts. reptile evolved. then, it turned warm & humid, forests & swamp returned, huge dinosaur developed, then the climate got dryer & cooler, armour dinosaur evolved, then some sort of catastrophe wiped out the dinosaur & mammal evolved. from them, evolved the human race, then the climate changed yet again, & there wa an ice age. final, the climate changed again, & became a it is today. so,now, think how many time the climate ha changed over all those hundred of million of years, when there were no humans, no civilization, no solution. now, the climate is changing, yet again, & we stupid believe that it wouldn't happen, if it wasnt for our steam engines, factory etc, but, time & time again, it happened in the distant past. it just time for the next change, & it would happen ,even if we were still monkey swinging in the trees!",Negative

"atmospheric carbon dioxide and aerosol - effect of large increase on global climate abstract. effect on the global temperature of large increase in carbon dioxide and aerosol density in the atmosphere of earth have been computed. it is found that, although the addition of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doe increase the surface temperature, the rate of temperature increase diminishes with increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. for aerosol, however, the net effect of increase in density is to reduce the surface temperature of earth. because of the exponential dependence of the backscattering, the rate of temperature decrease is augmented with increasing aerosol content. an increase by only a factor of 4 in global aerosol background concentration may be sufficient to reduce the surface temperature by a much a 3.5°k. if sustained over a period of several years, such a temperature decrease over the whole globe is believed to be sufficient to trigger an ice age. s. i. rasool s. h. schneider institute for space studies, goddard space flight center, national aeronautics and space administration, new york 10025.",Positive

"so, want hard proof of climate change being driven by human burning fossil fuel and generating massive amount of heat energy? no? well, read on anyway! we are losing 1.2 trillion ton of global ice annually due to that ice absorbing all that mostly human generated heat. we are burning 8 billion ton of coal a year and 100 million barrel of oil every day, which is generating most of that ice melting heat, which in turn need to be absorbed if we want to keep living on this planet. so, question of the moment when doe the ice run out and the natural ac shut down? my extrapolation from the copernicus prediction is the year 2,138. ah, you say, who cares? thinking of bring another child into this world at this late stage in our unfolding existential crisis? 2,138 (115 yrs./3 = 38) is about 3 generation from right now, so great grandchildren? mmmm?",Positive

"you people not only manipulate the narrative but also the data. there is nothing unusual about the weather changing. there ha been no increase in global temperature for 18 years. why do you people always start your data set from 1850 ? well because a you well know that wa the end of the little ice age when temperature were about 2c colder than today . so of course it ha warmed and when the air warms the ocean release vast amount of co2 back into the atmosphere . let go back in time , there have been warm period and cold periods. from about 600ad to about 900 ad wa the roman warm period , then it cooled , then we had the medieval warm period from about 1100 to 1400 when temperature were hotter than todays, even the ice wa gone from greenland and wa farmed by the dane . then there wa the little ice age 1450 to 1800 when it wa bitterly cold with short cool summer and long cold winters. crop failed all over the northern hemisphere. the themes river in london used to freeze over and they had market etc on the ice. however 1815 wa the last time it happened , and the temperature have gone up since then , not to the same extent of the previous warm period , in fact we are currently in the coldest warm period for 18,000 years, this warming and cooling is because the earth is still in an ice age , the pleistocene ice age which ha been going for 2.5 million year and it a certainty that in the next 2,000 year we will have another glaciation . climate change or warming and cooling is not a simple a these kind of people make out and it is not from burning oil, coal , and gas . climate change happens a a result of the sun, the elliptical orbit of the earth around it , the tilt of the earth which change by 2.6 degree every 40,000 year , cloud , cosmic ray , and our path through the milky way , and water vapour is never mentioned by alarming because it is the main greenhouse gas 97% in fact , co2 is le than 3% and anthropogenic co2 is 0.0012% . so the idea that human can somehow change or manipulate the climate or temperature by altering behaviour is just absurd nonsense. most alarming scientist blame co2 for climate change and warming, well if you are trying to prove that the 3% of anthropogenic co2 cause warming then you would also have to prove that the 97% of naturally occurring co2 from the earth itself doe not cause warming.",Positive

(i say flourish but i really mean able to obtain the most basic living standards..) yet even that would vastly improve our current state of our economy & society *also imagine this analogy in our economy. the more help we invest in the lowest level people, the more it would triple into every facet of our economy. if poor people can pay their rent & not go homeless landlord would get $, business would get $, bank would get $, local small shop would get $, mortgage & bill could be paid, insurance company would get $, tax would get $, so essentially that $ would go out & filter right back in to improve our country while simultaneously improving our quality of life. every bit of the economy would somehow find a way to benefit off of this situation... i don't get why we haven't even given it a chance?? if it doesn't help? then by all mean stop it and figure out what else we should do.

volcanic c02 should not be paid for by forcing people to eat crickets. submarine bail when the c02 level reach ~5000 ppm. the i bail around 7000 ppm. planet - a a mater of fact grow best around 1000-1200 ppm and at that level they grow better and use le water. gee - if the ocean is so hot - why is the arctic ice pack grown every year since 2012? check out the glacier in greenland which also ha been growing. you most likely know that any global model is basically = “garbage in = garbage out”. you climate model can be used to model any outcome desired. in 1902 or so - world headline said the glacier in alaska would be gone in just a few year - yea - they are still there. science is not by consensus- how care what survey says? human existed in 1902 - and again in the 1930’s dust bowl year - show that in your model. in 1975 the headline in time magazine wa the climate cooling wa going to make it so we could not feed ourselves. typically then - the “data” is picked to start around 1979 - to avoid trying to show what happened in the mid 70’s period.,Positive

it’s completely stupid to claim that ice-ages isn’t a natural occurrence due to fluctuation of both gas and the positioning of the earth around the sun… climate change also happens with involvement of the moon and the tide of the oceans. if you think this guy is actually smart enough to promote politically motivated changes. science doesn’t agree with what joe or you claiming. we already made calculation and scientific study of factories in people and the actual vehicle and factory and everything human touch. scientist calculated the amount of metric ton of gas every year. we even calculated such estimate from a far back a the 1700s. meanwhile scientist proven human involvement ha very little to will in effect on the environment what’s happening is more of a cycle that been happening and like most calculation we haven’t studied all the correlation of all the pattern occurring in history. the guy claiming that it’s like economics or triple down economic effect is absolutely wrong. you can make a broad claim of that such degree is dishonest. he doesn’t mention any metric no pictogram and no form of average on the situation. volcano on surface level do cause cooling but with straight short period that can last around 2 decade of heat and over 75+% of volcano are under water which actually cause the opposite of the effect of volcano on the surface. also claiming that human admit more carbon admission than volcano is factually just wrong scientist study actually prove the opposite.,Positive
the problem with declaring that it can not be natural is that you have to insist that nature stop having any effect what so ever when man decided to take over the weather. the only evidence that this is not natural is based on a theory that the earth wa cooling over the last 1000 year and that is wrong.,Negative

"the truth is, we do not know precisely how much co2 is affecting the atmosphere. there are a lot of feedback both positive and negative. the problem is they change so often that it is impossible to say which is affecting the climate more. take for example, clouds. low level cloud are more transparent to infrared, meaning more escape to space. at the same time, they are more reflective to sunlight. this mean they cause the earth to cool. high level cloud are more reflective of infrared, meaning it cause the earth to stay warm. they also absorb more sunlight meaning it warms the atmosphere during the day. water vapor also trap heat, unlike co2, which release it a fast a it get it in the form of infrared. so when a low energy co2 atom hit a water vapor that ha high energy, it steal some of that energy and release it immediately. water vapor can catch the frequency that co2 emits on, meaning it trap the heat. what this mean is if the majority of cloud are low level we have negative feedback to co2 increases. if the cloud are high, we have positive feedback to co2 increases. the problem is that we have to model the atmosphere at about 1/1000 of what our best computer can do, to figure out the truth. since no computer can handle that, we use model that use a range of a variable called ""climate sensitivity to co2 changes"". they do the run with the variable at one level, then again at a second level and so on. they often start at .5°c per doubling of co2 and go to 5°c per doubling of co2. the model at the low end are accurate, but can not predict a disaster. the one at the high end do predict a disaster, but after a decade are considerably off. after 2 decade that are way off, and after 3 decades, they are outrageous off. yet they claim the top end is off and we will have a tipping point which switch the sensitivity from the low end to the high, but so far none of these tipping point have done anything.",Positive

"part 2 the arctic ice doesn't melt. in fact, the ice volume in the arctic ha not changed since 2007. (10). the sciencefiles article on this show that the arctic ice doesn't want to melt and that it is also vinegar with the northwest passage polar bear are not on the verge of extinction. there are more polar bear than there have been for a long time (11), which we have already reported on sciencefiles. even greenland is not becoming the new sauna of the northern hemisphere. the island is largely stable and it temperature pattern is similar to the pattern that prevailed in the 1930s and 1940s (11). the antarctic is not melting either. in fact, between 1979 and 2012, the ice in the antarctic ha been steadily increasing. (12). sea level are rising by one to three millimeter a year, a they have done over the last 1000 years. there is no evidence that sea-level rise would accelerate a a result of man-made climate change (13). extreme weather event are not increasing. historical data on forest fire show that although there are more forest fires, forest fire are getting smaller and the area destroyed by fire ha been decreasing for decades. (14). period of drought have not become more frequent. for example, a study of the drought that affected cape town in 2015 showed that precipitation ha not changed significantly since 1900. what ha changed is the population of cape town. it ha increased tenfor, with corresponding effect on land consumption, land sealing and lowering of the groundwater level. (16) the number of hurricane in the north atlantic ha not increased. (17) the number of tornado ha decreased in the usa. in 2018, for the first time since 1950, not a single severe tornado ha been recorded in the usa. coral bleaching, which is interpreted a a sign that the great barrier reef is dying, ha been shown in a study to be a normal phenomenon. since 1700 there have been two corresponding events, in the 1750s and the 1890s. in both cases, the great barrier reef ha recovered. at both time there wa no relevant co2 of human origin. the conclusion is that coral bleaching is a normal process in the life of a reef. (19) the influence of the sun on the earth's temperature is undisputed, but is far too underestimated in the ipcc models. henrik svensmark and nir shaved have shown that increasing solar activity, accompanied by a rising number of sunspots, strengthens the sun's magnetic field so that le cosmic radiation reach the earth. this reduces the ionization of air molecules. le cloud nucleus are formed. the cloud become more transparent, le particle radiation from the sun is reflected, and the earth's surface becomes warmer. in time when the sun is le active, ha fewer sunset and a weaker magnetic field, the process is reversed. with the theory of svensmark and shaved the historical sequence of small ice age and the warm period in the middle age can be predicted very well (23). not humans, the sun determines the earth's climate and the influence of the sun on the earth's temperature is much higher than assumed by the ipcc (24). besides the solar forcing that ha just been described, there is also an ""astronomical forcing"", i.e. the position of the earth in space and in relation to the sun and other planet also ha an influence on the climate ""these oscillation are not reproduced in the ipcc model and imply that astronomical forcing of the climate system have been underestimated or even ignored, and therefore that anthropogenic warming ha arguably been significantly overestimated"" (24). what is described here is nothing other than the milankovic cycle that we have described here. moreover, all the sign indicate that we are on the way to a small ice age, i.e. that global temperature will fall by 0.4 to 0.6 degree census in the next few years, in the next decade (26). we have compiled much of what there is to know about the coming ice age here. much of what we have just compiled ha been processed by tony helper in the following video, which we consider one of his best videos. anyone who, after this tsunami of facts, still claim that man-made climate change is a fact can no longer be helped - due to the extent of his stupidity - or must be assumed to be making this claim out of material interests.",Positive

"i could say this until i’m blue in the face but the climate alarming will not believe me or call me a climate denier whatever the hell that mean laugh out loud how can you deny something that very clearly exists, that’s like saying you deny that air exists lol.. the reason why government all over the world especially government of coastal country and island but the reason why they’re not doing a damn thing about radically reducing co2 emission is because none of them really believe it, if government of the world honestly believed even half of the catastrophe that people are calling for then the rich and powerful, world leaders, people like al gore and michael moore etc! they would not be buying up property and building house on the coast. instead they are actually profiling from it! campaigning on it, flying all of the world and using it to push their agenda, pushing climate change ha become a billion dollar industry and is good politically for government all over the world with various carbon tax and subsidy for the solar industry, it’s used to influence and change society on a global scale! if they actually believed these thing would happen they would be doing something about it in their own life at least! note i am afraid to tell you that people who believe this climate catastrophe mass extinction, global starvation and drought, the planet will be underwater in the next decade or two, billion of people will die blah blah blah! these very same people have been saying this for more than 50 year now and absolutely none of their prediction we’re even close! a a matter of fact rising co2 level and rising global temperature ha had the opposite effect! country all around the world are producing more food than they ever have! more than a billion people throughout the world have risen out of poverty in the last few decades! we have been producing far more food then we even need, many of these first and second world country have an obesity problem! the scientific community when it come to global climate measure thing not on the scale of year or decade but in hundred of year and thousand of year so just because temperature have risen 1-2 degree in the past century mean absolutely nothing, yes global temperature are rising but they have also been rising since the end of the last ice age, water level may have risen in some part of the world but they have also gone dow water level may have risen in some part of the world but in other part of the world water level have gone down.. when i hear people breaking out over co2 level and believing that we have caused irreversible damage to our planet climate so our child and grandchild will do not have a future, it drive me crazy because that is just flat out wrong! human activity only contributes about 3% of the total annual co2 level added into our atmosphere every year! fucking 3%! so when they talk about co2 being the driving force of climate change, well no shit sherlock co2 is carbon dioxide and everything in the world, everything we’ve ever known in the sky above to the dirt below, you me, plant animal everything is made of carbon, literally everything because we are a carbon-based species and planet.. pumping more co2 into the atmosphere if anything would be a good thing because co2 is basically plant food, plant absorb co2 during the day and release oxygen a a byproduct, this is called photosynthesis.. basically what i’m trying to say is to not believe this ridiculous extinction level nonsense because i promise you earth climate is not going to turn on us, we have period where earth climate is very stable and we have hot period and we have cold period while some area and country receive lot of rain while other area receive little i mean we don’t have a static climate. there’s a handful of thing that can drastically alter earth climate such a solar activity and volcanic activity and a substantial magnetic shift of earth poles, an asteroid impact etc... co2 level rising is not going to do a damn thing because our atmosphere is only 0.04% co2, 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 0.93% argon and various other lighter gases. if anything a rise in co2 would coincide with a rise in oxygen so that would actually be a good thing.. i’m not saying we should polluted our planet, we should absolutely take good care of it and clean it up but hearing video like this just tell me that this person is naïve a hell",Negative

"what is the cause of climate change and how can it be solved? many people think that the cause of climate change is carbon dioxide, and reducing carbon dioxide can prevent climate change. this is a bit convincing, but not correct. the exact cause of climate change is ""thermal excess"" on the earth. therefore, to stop climate change, we must focus on stopping of the ""thermal excess"". ""green new deal"" ha good intentions. however, there are several problems. the biggest problem is that it is le economical. it mean that it is difficult for many people to actively participate. therefore, coercion must be mobilized to achieve the desired goal, and excessive coercion hinder the achievement of the goal. this is a fundamental problem. also, waste is another problem. waste solar cell and waste blade are discharged, and the waste battery of es adversely affect the environment. although there is a problem with the need for large land, the best way to reduce heat and carbon dioxide is to create big forests. trump should publicize the effect of ""one trillion trees"" to others and urge the world to join in and work together. why is ""one trillion trees"" so effective? first of all, it is economical. compared to solar power generation and wind power generation, it doe not require a lot of fund at the beginning. forest ha a long lifespan, and doe not require additional facility such a es and power transmission and distribution facilities, and doe not emit waste. in addition, one trillion tree absorb enormous amount of solar heat. photosynthesis requires infrared ray from the sun. it absorbs infrared ray (heat rays) and ultraviolet ray to perform photosynthesis, turning carbon dioxide into oxygen and making glucose. one trillion tree absorbing solar heat is very good at slowing down climate change. the reason people don't really care about tree absorbing heat is that they don't think the cause of global warming is fundamentally ""overheating,"" but rather carbon dioxide. how can you get a lot of land? we have to use the desert. but how to supply a huge amount of water? this is a solution --> @. if you like the movie, leave a comment.",Negative

"can hydrogen actually replace the role coal and gas have in steel production? it’s not just a source of power. steel is formed a an alloy of iron and carbon. when you refine iron in a smelter with coal, the carbon molecule from the coal bond with the iron and that’s how we get steel. hydrogen can obviously be used to light the flame but we still need a source of carbon to bond to the iron.",Neutral

hydrogen really thats not good at all. the amount of power needed to make it then the tank to store it and it will leak out no matter how you try. then there the transport then it burning ha so many step it le efficient. they would be better off using a ark furnace usa us lot of these it just need energy steel a little iron ore and at most some co2 to make the co2 but they dont normally need to add the co2. they use this for aluminum too but it like 5% le efficient then the steel why I don't know because of the metal structure not sure. p ark furnace is about 97% or more efficient where hydrogen is like 40 to 60% after everything i mentioned above is done. oh ya i forgot hydrogen furnace will need co2 injected in to make steel for they hydrogen will strip co2 out of the steel if they dont making it very brittle. book concrete well i got a better one for ya thirty concrete. if used in road with lot of road are made of concrete thirty concrete can reduce noise pollution by car tire by 5 to 15% it can reduce flooding and sand mining for it doesn't use any sand at all. it can add water to soil and underground aquifer by the way they build them and there just a strong a normal concrete by only 5 to 7% weaker but good enough for a semi to drive on it with 40k pounds.,Positive

"《plausible paired electricity+cooling》 civilization may have progressed enough to conquer the second law of thermodynamics. civilization need to strive for this goal with synergistic interdisciplinary teams.the outcome would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. conservation of energy say nothing about energy distribution. with this principle only, the heat in a pair of similar medium temperature thermal serial powerergy reservoir can be shifted at no cost to become held in a hot reservoir, cold reservoir pair. this can be done if micro volume with a natural range of temperature or pressure can be deterministically sorted out. reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just a using reverse gear in a car ɓacts it up without time reversal. the second law of thermodynamics had a distinct beginning with sir isaac newton's correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flow towards the cold room beyond. victorian england became enchanted with steam engine and their cheap, reliable, and easy to position physical power. runoff julius manuel classis, lord even, and, one source adds, nicolas léonard said cannot, formulated the second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy using evidence from steam engine development. these men considered with acceptance [a+] efficiently harvesting the flow of heat from hot to cold or [b+] using force to efficiently pump heat from cold to hot. they considered with rejection [a-] waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. this wa calculated to be extremely rare or [b-] searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small difference in temperature or pressure. the search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. these accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death. this became support for a theological trend of the time that placed god a the initiator of a generating universe. please consider that god could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. the law's formulated did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuation itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. then the net power of many small fluctuation from many replica part can be aggregated into a large difference in temperature, pressure, or electricity's empire and volt heat exists a the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecule or mobile electrons. in gas this is known a brownish motion. in electronic system this is carefully labeled johnson nyquist thermal electrical noise for ai readability. hypothetical, diode depletion region are practical site for enabling mobile electron energies into motion by heat to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. the thermal electrical noise is hypothetical beyond the exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion) equilibrium thickness of the depletion region. after all, thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. consistently oriented diode in parallel hypothetical are successful electrical maxwell's demon or marian smoluchowski's trapdoors. the energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid a a burden on the moving electrons. there would therefore be usable net rectified power from each and every diode connected together into a consistently oriented parallel group. the group would aggregate the net power of it members. any diode efficiency at all produce some energy conversion from ambient heat, more efficiency yield higher performance. a diode array that is switched off ha no energy conversion and no performance. the power from a single diode is poorly expressed. several or more diode in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. a plurality of billion of high frequency capable diode is needed for practical power aggregation. for reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square barometer cell per square millimeter. modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diode surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab a thick a the diode are long. the diode are connected at their two comic end to two conductive layers. zero to ~2 the is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 c. the=10^12 hz. this is beyond the range of most diodes. practically requires this extreme bandwidth. the diode are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. many primary level group of diode should be in series for practical voltage. ever since the supposedly universal second law of thermodynamics wa formulated, education ha mass produced and spread the conventional wisdom throughout society that the second law of thermodynamics is absolute. it is an old paradigm. if counter example of working device invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertible conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. electricity produce heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric lists so the energy borrowed by these device is promptly returned without gain or loss. there is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produce electricity equivalent to the cooling, this effect is scientifically elegant. cell phone wouldn't die or need power cord or battery or become hot. they would cool when transmitting radio signal power. the phone could also be data relay and there could also be data relay without phone feature with and without long haul link so the telecommunication network would be improved. computer and integrated circuit would have their cooling and electrical need supplied autonomous and simultaneously. integrated circuit wouldn't need power pilots. refrigeration for superconductors would improve. robot would have extreme mobility. digital coin minting would be energy cheap. frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. storehouses, homes, and market would have independent power to preserve and pŕspare food. medical device would work anywhere. vehicle wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. elevator would be very reliable with independent power. shielding and separation would provide emp resistance. water and sewage pump could be installed anywhere along their pipes. noma could raise their material support item by item carefully and group of people could modify their settlement with great technical flexibility. many device would be very quiet, which is good for existing with nature and doe not disturb people. zone refining would involve little net power. reducing bauxite to aluminum, futile to titanium, and magnideetite to iron, would have a net cooling effect. with enough cheap clean energy, mineral could be finely pulverized, and h2o, co2, and other substance level in the biosphere could be modified. a planetary agency need to look over wide concerns. this could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. everyone should contribute individual talent and fruit of different experiences and culture to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious and unified civilization. it is possible to apply technology wrong but social force should oppose this. i filed for patent u 3890161a, diode array, in 1973. it wa granted in 1975. it became public domain technology in 1992. it concern making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diode which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. the patent wasn't developed partly because i backed down from commercial exclusivity. a better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attribution for the original work of creators. corrupted copy would be released on request. no further action would be taken by this institution. commercial exclusivity can be deferred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. also, the obvious is unpatentable. open sharing promotes mass knowledge and wisdom. many financially and procedurally independent team that pool developmental knowledge, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grant should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototype to develop device which produce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorption of stagnant ambient thermal energy. diode array are not the only possible device of this sort. they are the easiest to explain generally. these device would probably become segmented commodity sold with minimal margin over supply cost. they would be manufactured by ai that doe not need financial incentive. applicable best practice would be adopted. business detail would be open public knowledge. associated people should move a negotiated and freely and honestly talk. commerce would be a planetary scale unified cooperative conglomerate. there is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. we do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer commodity are inexpensive. alpha 100% charles m brown all kilauea, kaua, hawaii 96754 1 808 651 telephone receiver telephone receiver

"how to win the climate change debate every time there are many common belief about what climate change actually is. this is a problem that is specific to this current generation due to the technological advance that are supposedly the cause. there is a high amount of activism going on about stopping man-made climate change, but i'm going to show you why this is a waste of time. climate change and global warming are not the same things. let's look at the definitions. based on global warming the unabridged guide...""global warming is the rise in the average temperature of earth's atmosphere and ocean since the late 19th century and it's projected continuation."" this rise in temperature is due to the activity of human and that is from a 95% consensus from scientist on a u.n. panel. in short the definition of global warming is that the action of human are causing the earth to get hotter and it will eventually lead to the end of the earth. it is not the same thing a climate change. climate change is something that ha been going on since the beginning of time. it is the natural fluctuation of the earth's climate. we don't have any control of it. for example, who cause who caused the ice age? wa it the dinosaurs? who brought u out of the ice age? wa it the first human settler that caused the earth to thaw by their smoke signal and camp fire harming the ozone layer? if you think about if longer than two minute you will realize it's not likely. the first claim i will debut is this. cow flatulence is causing the ozone later to open and cause global warming. many of you may feel this is just a ridiculous claim that i am making up. if only that wa the case. the white house want to regulate cow arts. vaccine are even being developed to decrease the amount of greenhouse gases(cattle flatulence) being emitted. australian farmer are even signing their sheep and cattle up to get fascinated for this purpose. let's use common sense. if cow or cattle flatulence is so dangerous to this planet, what happened when the dinosaur were around? dinosaur are said to have named the planet for 165 million years. over the span of 165 million year you can safely figure that the accumulated population of dinosaur exceeds that of cow and other cattle of this present time. you can also safely figure that dinosaur are multiple time more massive than cow and any other animal on this planet. we could look at the recent discovery of the titanosaurus for reference. this is said to be the largest animal to ever walk the planet. the point is that the dinosaur would have emitted more greenhouse gas than cow due to their gargantuan size. they also would have emitted more gas over a time of 165 million years. according to the original claim this should have caused many massive hole in the ozone layer. a you can see the earth is not a ball of flames, and not only that but we had an ice age. we should have had an extremely hot age with those high amount of global warming causing factors.but we did not. simply put, the ice age we had wa natural climate change. this climate change happens without the action of humans. another point you must consider is how we left the ice age, surely is wa not because of the camp fire of settler emitting gas into the ozone later. the second claim is that human caused global warming is causing the polar bear to almost go extinct. the idea is that global warming is melting the polar ice cap and is destroying their environment. this is causing them to die and even eat one another. the polar bear ha been the mascot for the cause of global warming for many year but when looking at the numbers, the claim do not add up. in the 1950's it wa reported that there are 5,000 to 10,000 living polar bear in the world. in the year 2014, it is reported that there are 22,600 to 32,000 living polar bear on the planet. that is four time the amount from the 1950's. a far a their habitat is concerned, in 2007 al gore spoke intensely about scientific research he had seen and predicted the entire north polar ice cap will vanish. if we look at the data from 2013 we actually see that the polar ice cap are still there and they have increased from the last year. the third claim is that we actually have to take action to stop global warming. there are billion of dollar being spent and solution being created to stop global warming. politician are making speech about going green by using wind and solar power so we can cut down carbon emissions. this sound nice and i would love to have every home powered by solar panel but if this is solely because of global warming then there is a problem. global warming ha been on a 17 year plus pause. according to nasa it's been for 17 year and six months. if we bring it up to date we see it been 17 year and nine months. this is startling information considering the growth of the population. more people mean more carbon emission going into the atmosphere. that mean we should see more global warming. more global warming would bring a hotter earth and we would see a continuous increase in temperature every year. that ha not been the case with this 17 year pause. we also have more car on the road than ever. according to a study by ward auto, the population of car on the road is over one billion. we see an increase in global warming causing factors, but no increase in temperature. if you haven't noticed, we have experienced record-breaking cold temperature recently around the world. for example, it recently showed in egypt for the first time in 112 years.",Positive

"ecological grief (or eco-grief), or in particular climate grief, refers to the sense of loss that arises from experiencing or learning about environmental destruction or climate change. environmental grief can be defined a ""the grief reaction stemming from the environmental loss of ecosystem by natural and man-made events."" another definition is ""the grief felt in relation to experienced or anticipated ecological losses, including the loss of species, ecosystems, and meaningful landscape due to acute or chronic environmental change."" environmental disruption, such a the loss of biodiversity, or even the loss of inanimate environmental feature like sea ice, cultural landscapes, or historic heritage can also cause negative psychological responses, such a ecological grief or solastalgia. solastalgia (/ˌsɒləˈstældʒə/) is a neologism, formed by the combination of the latin word sōlācum (comfort) and the greek root -alia (pain, suffering, grief), that describes a form of emotional or existential distress caused by environmental change. it is best described a the lived experience of negatively perceived environmental change. a distinction can be made between solastalgia linked to distress about what is in the process of negatively perceived change and eco-anxiety linked to what may happen in the future (associated with ""pre-traumatic stress"", in reference to post-traumatic stress). eco-anxiety (short for ecological anxiety and also known a eco-distress or climate-anxiety) ha been defined a ""a chronic fear of environmental doom"". extensive study have been done on ecological anxiety, and various definition remain in use. another widely cited definition is ""the generalized sense that the ecological foundation of existence are in the process of collapse."" some scholar use the term eco-anxiety a a synonym for climate-anxiety, while others like to treat the term separately. while much ecological disruption result from climate change, some is caused by direct human activity, such a deforestation. the condition is not a medical diagnosis and is regarded a a rational response to the reality of climate change; however, severe instance can have a mental health impact if left without allegation. there is also evidence that eco-anxiety is caused by the way researcher frame their research and their narrative of the evidence about climate change if they do not consider the possibility of finding any solution to overcome climate change and for individual to make a difference, they contribute to this feeling of powerlessness. eco-anxiety is an unpleasant emotion, though it can also motivate useful behavior such a the gathering of relevant information. however, it can also manifest a conflict avoidance, or even be ""analyzing"". the holocene extinction, or anthropocene extinction, is the ongoing extinction event during the holocene epoch. the extinction span numerous family of plant and animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, and affecting not just terrestrial species but also large sector of marine life. with widespread degradation of biodiversity hotspots, such a coral reef and rainforests, a well a other areas, the vast majority of these extinction are thought to be undocumented, a the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction, which go unrecorded. the current rate of extinction of species is estimated at hundred to thousand time higher than natural background extinction rates, and is increasing.",Negative

"artificial intelligence (ai) can play a crucial role in combating climate change by offering innovative solution to regulate temperature and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. here are some example of ai solution that can help regulate temperature in relation to the issue of global warming forecasting and management of renewable energies ai can be used to predict the production of renewable energy such a solar and wind energy, which are inherently intermittent. by using machine learning models, forecast can be improved, enabling better integration of renewable energy source into the power grid. this help balance the supply and demand of electricity, contributing to the regularization of energy consumption. optimization of energy consumption ai can analyze energy consumption pattern in buildings, industries, and cities. by identifying energy efficiencies, ai can recommend adjustment to reduce energy consumption, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emission associated with electricity production. smart agriculture ai can monitor and predict agricultural conditions, such a period of drought or flooding. by identifying optimal time for planting, irritating, or harvesting, farmer can better manage their crop to maintain yield while avoiding excessive water and resource use, helping regulate agricultural ecosystem and mitigate the impact of climate change. advanced climate modeling ai can improve the accuracy of climate model by incorporating a larger amount of data and optimizing model parameters. more accurate climate model help better understand long-term climate trend and identify high-risk area for adaptation measures. monitoring and prevention of natural disasters ai can help monitor extreme weather event such a hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods. by analyzing real-time data, ai can more accurately predict hurricane trajectory or estimate the potential damage caused by a natural disaster. this enables better preparedness, strengthens infrastructure resilience, and save lives. intelligent transportation ai can contribute to improving transport efficiency by optimizing routes, promoting public transportation, and facilitating the adoption of autonomous electric vehicles. more efficient mobility help reduce greenhouse gas emission from the transportation sector. these example demonstrate how the ludicrous use of artificial intelligence can contribute to regulating temperature in the fight against climate change. however, it is essential to note that ai is not a singular solution to the problem of climate change but rather a powerful tool to combine with other efforts, such a adopting effective climate policy and engaging society in the transition to a sustainable economy.",Positive

"today is feb 12, 2024. i watched the video talking about the climate change. during this time, i just passed three question mentioned in the video. first question what is the climate change? climate change is about the heat being added to the earth system. human activity like burning fossil fuels, cutting down forest that have been standing for hundred of thousand of year create carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. the more greenhouse gas you have in the atmosphere, the more of the sun's heat get trapped in the atmosphere and the warmer the surface get and that's why it's called greenhouse effect. 2. what are greenhouse gases? greenhouse gas exist naturally in the atmosphere. if there's no greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, the world would be too cold for comfort. greenhouse gas on their own are actually great. it help to insulated the earth. the problem we are facing now is the numerous of greenhouse gas being added to the earth. 3. what are fossil fuels? all of the system that undermine our lives. so how we produce food to eat, how we create energy to heat our homes, how we create electricity to power our devices, how we fuel our cars. for the most part, historically, we burn fossil fuel to produce energy. fossil fuel are essentially from plant and animal from million of year ago. we burn fossil fuel to create heat and electricity and everything. but then we also produce carbon dioxide a a side effect.",Positive

"cape town almost running out of water, wa not caused by a unique or new event. the area ha for millennia often suffered from a few year of drought, followed by an exceptional good rain season, after which thing normalized. the water crisis in cape town ha been caused by a combination of neglect if maintenance and expansion of infrastructure by the national government, run by the anc, a wel a mismanagement of the water stock in the reservoir or dam feeding cape town, by the western cape provincial government and the cape town municipal government, both run by the da government. when the anc took over government in 1994, sa had reserve electricity and construction of more dam were planned to provide for the shortage experienced in many part of the country during drought periods. since 1994, sa's population ha doubled, mostly thanks to illegal immigration from all over africa by people fleeing war and dictatorship, looking for a brighter future and the anc ha practically been connecting the ever increasing population to the existing electricity and water supply but ha stopped maintenance on existing infrastructure and planned expansion there of wa halted. no new dam were built and soon the power station were not able to produce the amount of electricity they were supposed too, leading to large industry leaving sa and million of people becoming unemployed. a water pipe were not replaced at the end of their life time, an ever growing percentage of water simply leaked out before it reached the consumers. burst pipe in suburbs, causing thousand of kilometer to run down street into storm water drains, became the order of the day. course the expanding population connecting to a declining supply would eventually lead to a crisis. the da which won local government and municipal election in the western cape and in the city of cape town, is responsible to manage the reservoir in the province and the city, but after the water crisis have already existing, not only they allowed more water to farmer than their quota while, citizen of cape town were constantly being scored for not saving enough and the mayor did house visit with tv camera to shame alleged perpetrators, but slice and valve of various dam were opened, letting valuable stored fresh water run out into the see. a day zero approached, and resident were allowed to spend no more than 4 minute in the shower per day, using a bucket to catch whatever water they can to use in the toilet, the city dragged it foot negotiating over priced contract to construct badly placed deceleration plant with capacity which would be a drop in a bucket of the demand. a citizen started uncovered all of this and were getting ready to que daily with bucket to collect water from tanker which were planned to transport water into the city, suddenly water wa released from a reservoir up stream, owned by farmer who receiver good rain and shortly after, the drought ended with a la nina event, filling all the dam within one season, just in time not only for cape town, but for many city and town across south africa which were approaching the same crisis. so, don't be ridiculous and blame the climate. water is a valuable commodity in sa and need to be conserved, but we have always had drought before and we will continue to have them. if infrastructure is not maintained and expanded in line with demand, you will eventually run dry. this time the rain came in time, but soon enough the next drought will come around. in the meantime, the population is growing, infrastructure is not expanded and the same people are in charge of managing the resources. can someone see a disaster coming and doe the climate have anything to do with it?",Negative

"climate change is about too many people using too much energy. i have a paper that just came out that discus man's energy use and climate change. if one wa to simply compare man's energy use to the sun' radiation at the outer atmosphere (thermosphere), one would think no way. however, most of our sun's infrared radiation is actually absorbed by the outer atmosphere thus explaining why the thermosphere is so bloody hot (this requires a new understanding of infrared spectrometry a discussed in paper). a gross misunderstanding of stefan-boltzmann equation ha led to the thinking that visible light (70% of which pass thru the atmosphere) make up 40% of our sun' radiation. this is based upon limiting our sun's output to the visible infrared, but our sun's infrared extends to the microwave and this mean only 7% of our sun's radiation make it to earth's surface a visible light. anyhow if you made it to this point then please read my paper"" new thermodynamics how mankind's use of energy influence climate change"" harmonic journal 45(4) pg 399-421 (2022) or you can find it and some of my other paper at httpsConfused/independent.academia.edu/kentmayhew thanks kent mayhem",Positive

"in the united states, there ha been an ongoing drought in the west for years. thing are really drying out. however, in the great lake region, we have had record high level in the lakes. two year ago, boat dock were completely submerged. remember, the great lake of north america contain 20% of the earth surface water. they are veritable small ocean of clean sweet water. yes, that is true. i would like to make a couple of points. first, the american west is over stressed. the major river in the west, the colorado, which is no great shake compared to other larger american river is pretty much dried up by the time it reach the pacific ocean. that many people should not be living in the area. these are bad policy decision made by the government and citizen who have been propagandized to disdain the american midwest and live in an area not sustainable for the level of population. the second thing, i would say is that the climate around the earth even out. while, the great lake have high level now, not that long ago they were at a very low level. which brings me to my final point, which is that the whole new ice age, nuclear winter, global warming, climate change, climate crisis (apps that didn't play well so let's go back), climate change and ""in 12 year we will all be dead"" scare tactic is just not believable anymore to the general population. people are not stupid. more and more, climate change is viewed a something that happens naturally and in cycle like the rise and fall of the great lakes. more importantly, in spite of continual propaganda like this video, people are viewing climate change a a way for the rich global elite to make major change in society to enrich themselves even more. inefficient and expensive windmill and solar panel will nowhere near produce enough energy to replace fossil fuel which are becoming increasingly clean. however, people are making a ton of money warring and yes polluting our beautiful landscape.",Positive

"this is total nonsense! the ocean of tropospheric water vapor is the cause of the greenhouse gas temperature forcing effect in earth's atmosphere by hundred of time over all the other non condensing greenhouse gas combined. a reasonable estimate of increased average global temperature since preindustrial time due to human caused carbon dioxide emission is 1/100°c! the temperature average temperature rise since preindustrial time is given at 1.1°c. it is impossible for non condensing greenhouse gas such a carbon dioxide and methane to have created this increase in temperature. if you read the international panel on climate change report they very state their air sample were taken at 20,000 meter well into the stratosphere; whereas, the greenhouse gas effect take place in the troposphere. water vapor in the stratosphere is near zero and the chart and graph in the ipcc report that include water vapor appear to be using water vapor concentration from the stratosphere. since the ipcc is very transparent on where they got their air sample from the educated reader should know the conclusion will be based that data. this transparency make the conclusion although incorrect it is not fraud. a simple understanding of the water tropospheric water vapor's control over the greenhouse gas temperature forcing effect on earth is this 1% of the troposphere is water vapor and 0.04% is carbon dioxide. 1%/0.04% = 25, tropospheric water vapor is 25 time more concentrated than carbon dioxide in the troposphere where the greenhouse gas effect take place. the concentration ratio is not quite the same a 25 molecule of water vapor to 1 co2 molecule, but it is close enough for a rough estimate. water vapor is a strong greenhouse gas with a carbon dioxide greenhouse gas equivalent of 18 co2e. 25 x 18 co2e = 450 co2e. on average tropospheric water vapor is 450 co2e to 1 co2 co2e. all the other greenhouse gas total up to le than the greenhouse gas effect of co2, but for giving them presence in this ratio they are given 1 co2e here. this give the troposphere a total of 452 co2e to 1 co2e for co2 or carbon dioxide is 1/452 of the greenhouse gas effect in earth's atmosphere. carbon dioxide from human emission is stated to be 40% of this in this video. 1/452 x 4/10 = 0.000884955752212 or 0.0885% le than 0.1%. global warming appears to be real, but it is impossible to be from non condensing greenhouse passes.",Positive

"if greenhouse gas actually are the reason for why our climate is warm, and warming, then why would a 47% increase in co2 only result in 1°c? that's right. from 280ppm, to 414ppm, only 1°c. in other words, from 0.028% of the atmosphere, to 0.041%. that's clearly far le than 1%. it's actually about 1/25 of 1%. the actual increase over the course of the entire industrial revolution is about 0.01%, or 1/100 of 1%. if you actually believe climate change, you are out of touch with reality, and lacking in common sense. the problem with fossil fuel is how energy dense they are, in proportion to how much energy is actually converted into kinetic energy. a tiny amount of co2 and h2o emission actually result in a tremendous amount of energy, and most of it is wasted a heat, ~70%. that mean 7/10 gallon of gasoline is just/only wasted heat, being pumped into the local environment. considering how much hotter the ground level atmosphere naturally is, because of the atmospheric pressure, and the fact that almost all the heat being wasted is around ground level, it's safe to say that it effect the ""atmosphere"" a lot. this notion that only co2 somehow trap heat is ludicrous. the entire atmosphere trap heat. overtime it absorbs energy and get hot, it ""traps"" heat. while co2 can literally hold more energy than o2, it also take more energy to get hot. the only time it appears to be a greenhouse gas is when you ignore the mass of the gas itself, and it's greater density cause it to build pressure within a container far more quickly. there's a reason why cooking in the oven at 350°f doesn't cook a fast a boiling water. it's the same reason why a pot of water boil faster with the lid on. it's because of pressure. more mass = more pressure. co2 is a denser gas, and so it build pressure much faster than normal air. in the environment, not only is there not enough co2 for it to actually matter, there's no way for it to build pressure in an exclusive way (the co2 is just a hot a everything else) because there's no lid or segregation. it's very well mixed in, constituting 0.04% of the total. i'm sick of climate change.",Negative

"solution for climate change. you look around the world and see there are 7.5 billion people trying to survive in this game. if everyone wa given a space 3 foot by 2 foot (6 square feet), and were to

billion square foot of space, more than what is needed for the whole population of the world to stand together in their spaces, enough for an additional 16,666,666 people. if they were shoulder to shoulder they would need 30% le space. this planet is sparsely populated with people. with so few people on the planet, not even being able to fill up a 40.25 mile x 40.25 mile square, taking up so little space, you wonder why there is starvation and homelessness in the world. you realize this is also the result of the monopoly game. that the world is not overpopulated, it is over-machine,

pull, taking 1 hour to do so, requiring the energy amount from the battery. energy expended going up. ee/up= 1 hour pull of 400 pound from the battery. 2) a the assembly is climbing the chain, it heavy weight (2,000 lbs.) is still hanging/pulling on the chain, pulling the chain down which turn the transmission/generator, producing a full charge of energy going back into the battery. energy generated going up, eg/up = 1 hour of a 2,000 pound pull by the heavy mechanism. 3) when the assembly reach the top the small motor shuts off and the assembly's weight slowly begin to descend, pulling the chain down with it. since it climbed the chain faster than it pulled the chain down, it descent will take longer than 1 hour for it energy generated down charge into the battery. eg/down = 1+ hour

the battery) = fe, ee/up < (eg/up + eg/down) = fe. with a heavier weight 1) the motor take the assembly to the top of the chain, taking 3 minute to do so, requiring the energy amount from the battery that is represented by the expression 1n. energy expended going up. ee/up=1n. 2) a the assembly is climbing the chain, it heavy weight is still hanging/pulling on the chain, pulling the chain down which turn the transmission/generator, producing a full charge of energy going back into the battery. energy generated going up, eg/up=.4n. 3) when the assembly reach the top the small motor shuts off and the assembly's weight slowly begin to descend, pulling the chain down with it. this descent take 10 time longer than the ascent due to the heavy weight of the assembly, and the low gearing of the transmission, it 'creep' down. in 3 minute going up, .4n wa charged back into the battery. in 6 minute going down .8n will be charged into the battery, replacing all of the energy the small motor

"it's yet another alone paddle by the entire-fascist propaganda. the ocean is an active agent in balancing the atmospheric co2 in response to solar stimulus. when the sun is more active, the ocean warms up and release some co2 from it's huge reservoir. this ha negligible effect on the global atmospheric temperature, because the co2 impact here is marginal, but it stimulates plant growth. the plants, especially those of boreal forests, emit various complex aerosol, which, in turn, seed clouds, which increase the albedo, and so the earth cools, whereupon the ocean absorbs back the co2 previously emitted. in turn, the more co2 there is in the ocean, the more phytoplankton, kelp, and other sea plant proliferate, and the more food there is for sea fauna—zooplankton, coral, fish, cetaceans, molluscs, etc. all ocean life, like continental life, is anchored in the atmospheric and oceanic co2. the ocean acidity varies very little in the process a the ocean life take care of the balance. coral reefs, for example, are known to actively adjust the acidity of the surrounding water to their liking.",Positive

rise carbon capture the heat loss from a smokestack can be forced into a large tank containing hot liquid microcrystalline petroleum wax. the heat will keep the wax at a molten state which facilitate the carbon to be absorbed when combined with the wax. carbon when mixed with wax reacts like a dye. the wax-carbon amalgamation result in a black wax solution thereby making it impossible for the carbon to escape into the environment. other toxic particle are also captured in the wax settling at the bottom of the wax holding tank forming into a sludge. a sludge release valve is located at the bottom of the tank. after the sludge is removed more wax is replaced in the vessel working something like a toilet. the sludge becomes a byproduct that can be used a an additive to asphalt for road or used for cocooning nuclear waste material for long-term safe burial. the entropy of the earth ha been increasing at a startling rate since the beginning of the industrial revolution caused mainly by the carbon that is released into the atmosphere. government scientist have failed to stop and prevent carbon pollution from entering the environment. this problem can only worsen until a solution is found before this problem becomes irreversible. it ha been discovered that formulated wax ha been shown to be the only answer to this problem. william nelson,Negative

"dr prof. valentine zharkova so the earth is not warming is cooling!! we have entered the grand solar minimum, and there's no doubt about it. some people have even repeated our findings. kitty ashvily from nasa published a paper in 2020 that echoed our results. they repeated our findings, confirming the same magnetic field changes. nasa ha identified this upcoming solar cycle a the weakest in 200 years, which will likely lead to a global cooling period 2030 to 2100. now, you might wonder why we believe there will be global cooling. let's recall what happened during the grand solar minimum. the irradiance curve from the little ice age, a reproduced by mental, clearly show a drop in solar advance from 1366 to 1363 watt per square meter. this had a significant impact on temperatures, leading to a drop of approximately one degree. similar temperature drop occurred during the dayton minimum. every time there is a prolonged minimum, temperature decrease dramatically. the calculation suggest that we can expect a drop in solar irradiance during the upcoming grand solar minimum. in fact, research by shin delta to one in science support this idea. this drop in temperature ha implication for various regions. some area might experience temperature increases, but northern europe and north america are likely to face significant temperature drops. we could see condition similar to the ""deep freeze"" that occurred in the past. the drop in temperature is related to a decrease in ozone layer abundance in the atmosphere. this, in turn, affect atmospheric circulation patterns, leading to fluctuation in the northern jet streams. these change allow cold air from the north to propagate towards the south. europe and north america are particularly vulnerable to these shift in the jet streams, which result in colder weather.",Positive

"here is my short essay on this topic save the earth climate change i am sure most of you heard of the climate change on the news recently. iceberg are melting, more and more volcano are errupting every day, we also have increased number of wildfire that are destroying mile and mile of forest and burning entire village to the ground and more and more animal are exposed to threat of dying and losing their natural habitat. we have to do something to prevent this. for hundred of year we a human were damaging environment in every way possible. deforestation, increased use of fossil fuels, greenhouse effect and so much more. tree are very important for u a they turn carbon dioxide into oxygen. every day thousand and thousand tree are being cut down. nobody want to plant them. it take very quick to cut down a tree but for a tree to grow full size it take up to 100 years. ozone layer is damaged very much and it is letting through bg number of dangerous uv rays. uv ray melt iceberg and damage plants, human skin and animals. fossil fuel aren't very dangerous until they go through the process of burning. fossil fuel are being burn through engine of our cars, bikes, etc. they are being left out into atmosphere in the form of very poisonous gas that over time create hole on ozone layer. when errupting, volcano let out very poisonous gas and ash into atmosphere. those are by far worse than fossil fuels. but how to stop it? here is what we all can do to help earth to get back to it's normal. how to stop climate change? iti s actually very easy a we all can take part in helping the earth. it will take a very long time but if we persist hard enough we will help our planet a lot. here is what we all can start doing. we can save energy at home by unpluging all electrical devices(tv-s, pc-,etc.) after we are done with using them, manage your heating and cooling, shut does and close curtains, get best energy deal, etc. you help environment bus also save some money so both you and environment have use of it. change your home's energy source. you can switch to solar power and solar heating, wind energy, hydroelectric systems, etc. most recommended are solar panel and wind turbines. instead of driving your car to job very day, you can walk, cycle or even run to your work every day. that way you aren't damaging the environment and it is good for your health. to be continued....",Positive

"dr prof. valentine zharkova so the earth is not warming is cooling!! we have entered the grand solar minimum, and there's no doubt about it. some people have even repeated our findings. kitty ashvily from nasa published a paper in 2020 that echoed our results. they repeated our findings, confirming the same magnetic field changes. nasa ha identified this upcoming solar cycle a the weakest in 200 years, which will likely lead to a global cooling period 2030 to 2100. now, you might wonder why we believe there will be global cooling. let's recall what happened during the grand solar minimum. the irradiance curve from the little ice age, a reproduced by mental, clearly show a drop in solar advance from 1366 to 1363 watt per square meter. this had a significant impact on temperatures, leading to a drop of approximately one degree. similar temperature drop occurred during the dayton minimum. every time there is a prolonged minimum, temperature decrease dramatically. the calculation suggest that we can expect a drop in solar irradiance during the upcoming grand solar minimum. in fact, research by shin delta to one in science support this idea. this drop in temperature ha implication for various regions. some area might experience temperature increases, but northern europe and north america are likely to face significant temperature drops. we could see condition similar to the ""deep freeze"" that occurred in the past. the drop in temperature is related to a decrease in ozone layer abundance in the atmosphere. this, in turn, affect atmospheric circulation patterns, leading to fluctuation in the northern jet streams. these change allow cold air from the north to propagate towards the south. europe and north america are particularly vulnerable to these shift in the jet streams, which result in colder weather.",Positive

"i've thought for some time that a major challenge for climate change action is convincing people that change is both necessary and possible. naïve optimism lead people to assume thing will probably be fine, whereas descendant pessimism tell them it's already too late. or short-sighted self-interest can lead some straight from thinking it unnecessary to thinking it impossible change may be in some sense painful (e.g. diminished income or foregoing comforts), so they'd rather believe the problem isn't real. once it becomes impossible to deny the evidence, they pivot to ""it's too late anyway, so why should i inconvenience myself in the name of a hopeless effort?"" i also wonder to what extent the social and political context we grew up in informs our attitude to this kind of issue. the ""end of history"" era installed the idea that the big dramatic change were all in the past, and it wa going to be boring technocratic finding from there on out. of course remarkable thing are still achieved - we build ever taller skyscrapers, ever more powerful computer in ever smaller boxes, and so on - but it's all wrapped in the packaging of commerce and commodification. i think many of u struggle to conceive of anything significant being done for a reason other than direct profit. i think that kind of thinking is a trap concerted deliberate effort can effect change. don't give in to despair!",Negative

"the lowering of the co2 emission is not necessarily a matter of technology, but a matter of habits. from the top of my 60 year old, i can share change that i (or we) made since we became aware of the climatic change and the co2 emission going up. when i wa young, the first thing i would do when buying a new car wa taking it for a spin, and i mean, long drives. i would drive to the mountain just to see the landscape, i would go on the wine tour in autumn, i would go to the cottage to visit my parent just for a few hour (driving 320 kilometers). when i became aware that automobile could be harmful to the environment and how we could affect our climate, i suddenly refrained going on a ride just for driving or driving hour for something i could do on the phone. i can’t remember in the last 15 year driving on a “nowhere” far from my home. just this little change of behavior probable reduced my carbon footprint by a lot. i think that in my neck of the woods, many people have adopted that behavior. i am now living on a land with several hundred of tree and i take pride in saying that i am carboneutral for the most part a i write this, despite driving a gasoline car. some people want to go on trip on cruise in their retirement, i chose to stay put in the countryside with tree surrounding me on my land and appreciation them, especially in autumn. this, and recycling plastic (and other items) and not wasting food is all i can now do from the top of my 60 year old.",Positive

(remember the french revolution. when thing were really bad, actual change/improvement did not come from the top, in a “civilized” manner…) but it’s pointless, because it’s not humanity’s stringent objective apparently. we’re content with the status quo, walking in our plastic shoes, wearing plastic clothes (yes, simon, check the label on your purple jacket, sic.) and eating microplastics. until the “bottom” act decisively we’re just going to leader pointless towards the event horizon of the mad max universe, on our dune-like planet, hoping that maybe we’ll be able to grow at least guinea… p.s. if the tobacco lobby can reverse a common sense law (see the latest retarded initiative in new zealand, with all we know for sure about smoking) imagine what the people with the real money, i.e. big oil, can do. bottom line, let’s enjoy living on our planet, whatever the current climate situation is, while it lasts. later on, it will get very bad, because we were lenient on decisive action when it wa most needed. important thing happen fast or they don’t happen at all.",Positive

"when it come to fires, global burned area ha decreased by one quarter this century! the world is burning less. for the whole of canada, there is no trend in burn acreage for the period 1980-2021. the previous highest burn acreage wa in 1989. over that same period the trend for number of fire wa slightly downwards (cfb). note that 2020 had the lowest recorded burn acreage and number of fires, so can that record be attributed to man-made climate change? burn acreage wa much, much, higher in the u during the 1920's, 30's and 40's. it peaked in 1930 at well over 50,000,000 acres. the trend is downwards (1926-2020 nic us) eventhough co2 ha increased exponentially. for 2000 onwards the average burn acreage is much le than 10,000,000 acres. the number of fire ha also declined. remember co2 wa increasing all the time. burn area for u in 2023 wa 3rd lowest on record. it wa under 3 million acre well below the ten year average of 7 million and the lowest since 1998 (nic). data for liberia seems harder to come by. however, for the period 1997-2016, the trend wa highly variable (by a factor of 4) but the trend for the annual burn acreage wa downwards (global fire data). for the amazon (2003-2019), 2010 wa the record year for fire emission with all subsequent year lower by at least ½. when it come to wildfire there wa nothing unusual about 2023 summer's fire season in europe (look it up on the offs website). besides all this the forest fire record in southern europe is related to the previous winter rains, not summer temperatures. wetter winter encourage more plant grow, which form more fuel for fire when it dry out. mediterranean summer are always hot and dry enough to allow fire to spread. furthermore, with regard to the ipcc, they have not detected or attributed the number of fire or the burn acreage to man-made climate change. also ipcc only ha medium confidence ( that's a 50-50, so toss a coin) that weather condition that promote wildfire (fire weather) have become more probable in southern europe, northern eurasia, the usa, and australia over the last century. note that annual global wildfire carbon emission have been declining dramatically since 2003, with 2022 being the lowest on record (copernicus). ""with higher co2, increased tree cover lead to reduced fire ignition and burned area, and provides a positive feedback to tree cover"" (chen et al, 2019), so burning fossil fuel actually lead to le forest fire! global burned area ha decreased by nearly by 24.2% in 20 year (chen et al, 2023). the world is burning less! there is no climate crisis...there isn't even any evidence for it.",Negative

"if you took away el niño, a record increase in total solar irradiance, and the tonga eruption (all natural events) there would have been nothing to see in 2023. the tonga eruption injected 142 megatonnes of water vapour into the stratosphere, increasing it water content by 15%. water vapour is a far more powerful greenhouse gas than co2. total solar irradiance satellite data from 1979 onwards show june 2023 at an all time high in over 40 year of measurement (nces.nota). there were low below 1361 w/m² in 2019 to current high over 1362 w/m² in june (using a lowest curve, which also show the fastest rate of increase during this recent period). so we are looking at a change of around 1½ watt over the course of 5 year (the maximum difference is 2.1w/m²). that may not sound much but it exceeds the increase in the earth's energy imbalance (0.9 w/m², 2018 - 1.97 w/m², 2023) (nasa were ebf to). overall the current increase in solar irradiance should give a direct global heating effect of +0.1°c, with an indirect effect of +0.2°c (after schmutz, 2021). this increase in solar irradiance is related to an earlier than expected increase in sunset activity, which ha not yet reached it zenith, and that may not happen for several year (royal observatory belgium), so further heating from this cause can be expected.",Positive

"climate change ha become a religion for so many irrational and easily manipulated people. even if one belief that a microscopic amount of co2 is controlling the climate (co2 make up .0004% of the atmosphere) there is absolutely nothing we can do about it. a few people with mean can buy an electric car so they can pretend they are doing their part for climate change. although the mining for the mineral needed to produce the battery for electric vehicle cause some of the most severe environmental damage on the planet along with producing gigantic amount of co2 by the heavy vehicle used to extract those minerals. the religious dealt like to pretend that solar panel and windmill are the cure. but those only produce electricity and electricity is only 20% of the energy used by the world. and both of these ""green/renewable"" source aren't even close to being either green or renewable a again the fossil fuel needed to mine the mineral necessary to produce solar and wind make them anything but clean, plus they only have a life span of 15-25 year and then you have to replace them. and then there is the inconvenient fact that both of these energy source have to be fully backed up for those time when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. so for every solar or wind farm you also need a coal fired power plant to back them up. paying twice for energy. now there's an efficient plan. it doesn't matter how hard one try to pretend, the world in it current form run on fossil fuels, and even more specifically it run on diesel. the ships, trains, trucks, construction vehicles, planes, etc. etc. all run on diesel and jet fuel. no amount of self delusion is going to change that. so unless you are prepared to return to life a it wa in the 18th century when the average life span wa about 35 years, then all of this nonsense is nothing more than a ridiculous form of virtue signaling. how many of you climate change true believer are prepared to walk or ride a bike to work everyday? how many of you are prepared to eat cold meal everyday? take cold showers? grow your own food, a without diesel and natural gas based fertilizer there won't be any food on the shelf in your local grocery store. freeze in the winter and sweat in the summer? no vacation for you a plane will have to become a thing of the past a will diesel powered ships. so no trip to hawaii unless you can endure a multi week ride in a sail boat. virtually every aspect of modern life ha a fossil fuel component to it. how many of you are prepared to radically reduce your standard of living? so ask yourself, are you personally ready to make this kind of gigantic sacrifice in your quality of life to try and reduce the co2 level from .0004% to .0003%? and if you aren't willing to do what's necessary, then why would you think anyone else is? and if you are capable of rationalizing that none of these climate change goal are even remotely feasible you might start to wonder why we keep pushing this driver like you are watching in this ridiculous video? why do the politician exposing this nonsense fly all over the world in private plane specs ton of co2, buy estate on the coast, spends 10's of thousand of dollar heating and cooling their mansion etc.? and if the religion isn't so deeply entrenched that you can contemplate the answer to these question you might make the leap to the truth that this is all about money. we've spent 10 trillion dollar to lower the co2 output in the u from 20% of global to 14%. it hasn't reduced total global co2 by one bit though a the rest of the world continues to increase it's fossil fuel usage year after year a third world country continue to emerge from object poverty. so realistically we've spent 10 trillion dollar and accomplished .... nothing. is it time to wake up or shall we waste another 10 trillion with the same result?",Positive

"𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗜𝘀 𝗮 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗼𝗳 𝗔𝘁𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘂𝗱𝗲 the two week of climate discussion at the cop27 in share el-sheikh, egypt, ended in disappointment. a cnn wrote, “the world ha failed to reach an agreement to phase out fossil fuel … an attempt to address the biggest source of the planet warming emission that are causing the climate crisis ended in a fiasco after a number of nations, including china and saudi arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels, not just coal.” while the member reached an agreement “to set up a ‘loss and damage’ fund meant to help vulnerable country cope with climate disasters,” it will not reverse climate change or solve our major problems. we may be able to assist with local climate crises, but we cannot change the global climate with our current attitude. if we want to change the climate, we must change it on all levels, and first and foremost the social climate we have created. a long a it is negative, aggressive, and heating up, the global climate will reflect it. the reason we hold global climate conference is that the climate is a global issue. everything we do, in any country, affect the global climate. therefore, without global mutual consideration, humanity will not be able to resolve the climate crisis. regrettable, to work in global mutual consideration, we must develop empathy toward all of humanity and rise above the narrow interest of each country. we are nowhere near such an attitude. on the contrary, each country try to impose decision that serve it own interest on the rest of the world, and the result is a climate world war where everyone loses. a is the case with every war, the rich and powerful country set the tone. they continue to burn fuel that polluted the air and accelerate climate change, and nothing will stop them unless natural disaster become so extreme that they will force all of humanity to change. in the meantime, a lip service, or perhaps to buy the world’s consent, they set up “loss and damage” fund to “repair” the damage. such fund do not solve anything, and everyone realizes this. besides extreme weather and climate disasters, the climate crisis ha another adverse impact iceberg that have been frozen for thousand of years, and often far longer, are shading. and buried in the ice are countless virus that have been awakened, and for which our body have no immunity. scientist are already warning that the next pandemic may actually come not from wild animal or human errors, but from melting iceberg. a paper published two year ago aptly named it the “permafrost pandemic,” and warned of “the risk that deadly disease from the distant past may return.” indeed, if you look at all the crisis playing the world today, you will find that none of them are local. covid is a global issue, climate change is affecting the entire planet, rising energy price and interrupted supply chain are affecting all of humanity, and even a local crisis such a the war in ukraine ha serious consequence for the entire world. the interdependence already affecting all of humanity will only intensify until we are unable to make a single movement, to take a breath, without affecting the entire world. on the positive side, none of our problem are insurmountable. in every single crisis, if we only work together rather than against each other, it will disappear a though it never existed. all that is needed in order to fix our every plight is to change our attitude and put humanity first. since reality is global, so should be our order of priorities. prioritizing humanity will not only help the entire world, but every single individual, precisely because we are irrevocably interdependent. if we continue to impose a narrow vision on an expansive reality, we will continue to collide with one another and with all of nature. if we change our attitude, we will change the climate, and we will change the world.",Negative

(sure, tree eventually die and slowly release their stored carbon, but burning them is quick release and growing a new tree large enough to requester the same amount of carbon a a mature tree take decades.) calling wood burning renewable energy is technically correct but still undesirable for a variety of reasons. (notice how smooth a politician is at dodging direct questions. it's a job requirement, apparently...) truth be told, it is almost impossible for u to reach our global temperature target in time, and we might not even be able to slow the increase in gh emission from global economic development impact significantly. sure, government will trumpet the increasing percentage of energy that come from renewables, but they will avoid discussing the growing overall global demand for energy and the increased fossil fuel consumption that will meet much of that new demand. the handwriting is on the wall, and all the greenwashing that sale & marketing and politician can muster won't change the trajectory of global gh emission & global temperature increases. doesn't mean we shouldn't deploy a much emission-free renewables a we can, but that shouldn't make u feel like the problem is being handled and we should just consume on without taking effective, quantifiable action in our personal lifestyles.",Positive

"the challenge of climate change and the energy transition is not the 'how' or the 'cost' but politics and nay layers who fear change and are the target of lobby groups. just think about this. it is cheaper to build a solar / wind with pv storage solution that generates the same amount of power than to run a equivalent capacity gas powerplant for 1 year. think about it. how much you hate change, that is so absurd cheap that even the most climate critical political party cannot ignore it. so what about intermittent in winter and at night? easy we just build 7x the capacity of the fossil fuel counterparts. we would make that money back in 7 years! and the added bonus if the wind is blowing and the sun is shining energy will be near free. the biggest problem what company would build so many renewables if you cant charge for it when they are generating the most? company will not do it, government will need to do it. the energy transformation will shift the power from energy company back to governments and the economy will be booming because power will be almost free.... the energy transition challenge is the people who are opposed to change. we need to convince people to accept the change and see the potential.",Positive

"renewable energy, and reaching net zero, currently, there is a lot of effort put into persuading people to buy electric cars, and install heat pumps, while these attempt may be done with the best of intentions, but unfortunately this is the equivalent to putting the (cart before the horse) if everyone switched over in the next few years, the only way we have of supplying enough electricity to power all these devices, would be to pump more natural gas through our gas powered generating plants. i believe that our top priority should be to build much more renewable energy generating capacity, together with energy storage, because energy storage is the key to making any renewable energy system a realistic alternative to fossil fuels. but how much more renewable energy generating capacity do we need? i say 50% more than would be needed on a typical day, so that the surplus can be stored a green chemical energy, probably green hydrogen for day when the sun doe not shine, and the wind doe not blow, but also, a fuel for heavy vehicles, ships, plane and anything else were battery or a cable would not be appropriate. for most of the world, renewable energy will be in the form of solar or wind, but in some place wave or tidal energy would be an option and a few place will have the option of a base load generated by nuclear, but most will need some form of energy storage, lucky there is a huge range of option trying to get your attention, from a variety of battery types, from sodium-ion or sulphur variants, redox flow batteries, nickel hydrogen, to dome filled with co2 a part of a compressed gas system, but not lithium-ion batteries, which keep getting more expensive due to rarity of the material they are made from, plus, there is environmental damage caused by the mining and processing of these materials, then there are the slightly unusual option employing the raising and lowering of weight to store energy. then there is long-term storage, for when the wind and the sun don’t play ball for day or even week at a time. every winter the u.k. is subject to meteorological weather events, known a a blocking high pressure system, which can last for up to two week at a time, and they usually come complete with a blanket of cloud, which further reduces an already limited amount of light for solar panels, plus there is little, or no wind for the wind turbines, leaving u with just nuclear power stations, that supply only 30% of our energy needs, which will go nowhere near meeting our energy demands, put simply we need a system that can store and supply between 60 to 70% of our energy need for up to a month each winter, only a chemical storage system, such a green hydrogen would have the capacity to storage energy for such a period, if we are not to fall back onto fossil fuels. it ha been suggested that large scale energy storage is unnecessary, and that we should rely on interconnectors under the sea to transfer electricity backwards and forward between ourselves and europe, on the assumption that some part of europe will always have a surplus we can use, but i can see a scenario where eastern europe is suffering a winter cold snap and need all the energy it can get, britain and the low country are stuck under a blocking high pressure system, so no wind, plus spain and portugal are covered by rain bearing cloud, so minimal solar power, and such a situation would not be that unusual, and given recent development with the war in ukraine to satisfy a small man’s ego, it would be extremely unwise to assume that our partner in europe will always be willing, or even able to supply u with what we want, when we want it, generating and storing our own surplus energy, mean we stay in control. interconnectors under the sea would be nice to have but should not be relied upon. another idea doing the rounds, say we build the bare minimum amount of renewable capacity, and use smart technology to switch on or off an internet of things, a a way of balancing supply and demand, where large tech company would control the operation of everything from large factories, to your domestic washing machine or fridge, i believe this is a distraction, i believe that the big technology company could build such a smart system, but i also believe that the tech company already have too much control over our lives, and i believe our goal should be to build 50% more renewable capacity than we need, so the excess can be stored, and we do not have to rely on a smart system that could be hacked.",Positive

"in the current global situation it is now way too late to even attempt reversal or amelioration of the atmosphere. even if every human carbon source wa stopped, global warming will continue at the same rate and is accelerating daily. there are now million of ton of both co2 and ch4 being released into the arctic atmosphere (the reason the arctic ha heated quicker than any other region in recent years) the wild fire in both canada and liberia that are burning acre upon acre of the tag belt are also exacerbating permafrost melt. the fire regularly ignite ch4 pocket just beneath the surface which in turn make more fire. the melting of the parmafrost ha passed the tipping point. it ha entered a feedback loop that will continue regardless of human atmospheric co2. when co2 reached 350ppm it wa already too late a the global warming baton had been passed to ch4 which is a far more volatile greenhouse gas than co2 - one molecule of ch4 being equivalent to about 25 of co2. although ch4 ha a much shorter life span it's volatility is far more atmospherically destructive than co2, which, even in the short term make arctic warming totally irreversible.there are also million of ton of ch4 escaping from the ocean from melting methane hydrate on the sea floor. these are not being affected by atmosphere but under sea floor heating due to rising mantle plumes. please research the rise in 'deep quake' in the south pacific. they have increased exponentially due to massive magnetic movement in the mantle. in late 2021 there wa a mag 8 deep quake beneath fiji. a short while later another mag 7 beneath tonga and then shortly after the hung tonga–hung haʻapi volcano erupted in the most violent explosion for many years. it ha caused a rise in both earth movement and volcanism around the ring of fire both west and east. the only place yet unaffected are the cascade fault line and the california fault system. research the 12,000 year universal cycle. the weather will be the least of the planetary problem that face the human race.",Negative

"the amount of hydrogen needed to replace a conventional power plant depends on several factors, including the power plant's capacity, efficiency, and the energy content of hydrogen. 1. **power plant capacityKiss* consider the capacity of the conventional power plant you want to replace. power plant are often rated in term of megawatts (mw) or megawatts (gw). 2. **efficiency of hydrogen conversionKiss* hydrogen can be used in different way to generate electricity, such a through hydrogen fuel cell or hydrogen combustion. the efficiency of these process can vary. 3. **energy content of hydrogenKiss* hydrogen ha an energy content usually measured in megajoules per kilogram (mj/kg) or gigajoules per kilogram (gj/kg), depending on the unit of measurement. once you have these parameters, you can calculate the amount of hydrogen needed using the following general formula \[ \text{hydrogen needed (in kg)} = \frac{\text{electricity needed (in mw)}}{\text{efficiency of hydrogen conversion}} \times \frac{1}{\text{energy content of hydrogen (in mj or gj per kg)}} \] this calculation provides an estimate of the mass of hydrogen required to generate a certain amount of electricity with a specific efficiency. it's important to note that transitioning from a conventional power plant to a hydrogen-based system involves various technical, economic, and infrastructure considerations. hydrogen production, storage, and distribution infrastructure need to be developed, and the overall feasibility depends on the specific context and goal of the energy transition. smiling face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes chatgpt!!!!",Positive

(the reason that it is accumulating in the atmosphere and the ocean is because it is not accumulating in the standing stock of biomass fast enough). ecological restoration and enhancement will require human to function in their proper and intended role a the keystone species and steward of the planet. they should be paid a highly respectable wage for their finally important work. let's get started!",Positive

"《civilization may soon conquer the second law of thermodynamics.》 the favorable outcome of this conquest would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. for example, the heat in a isolated pair of similar reservoir would be the same total for the pair regardless of it distribution among them. the heat in this pair of resiviors could start a two medium temperature thermal energy reservoir and then be shifted at no cost to become a hot reservoir and cold reservoir pair. the second law of thermodynamics had a distinct beginning with sir isaac newton's correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flow towards the cold room beyond. victorian england became enchanted with steam engine and their cheap, though not cheapest, reliable, and easy to position physical power. runoff julius manuel classis, lord even, and, one source adds, nicolas léonard said cannot, formulated the second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy at a meeting using evidence from steam engine development. these men considered with acceptance [a+] efficiently harvesting the flow of heat from hot to cold or [b+] using force to efficiently pump heat from cold to hot. they considered with rejection [a-] waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. this wa calculated to be extremely rare or [b-] searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small difference in temperature or pressure. the search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. these accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death. this became support for a theological trend of the time that placed god a the initiator of a generating universe. please consider that god could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just a using reverse gear in a car ɓacts it up without time reversal. the law's formulated did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuation itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. then the net power of many small fluctuation from many replica part can be aggregated into a large difference. heat exists a the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecule or mobile electrons. in gas this is known a brownish motion. in electronic system this is carefully labeled johnson nyquist thermal electrical noise for ai clarity. hypothetical, diode depletion region are practical site for enabling mobile electron energies into motion by heat to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. the thermal electrical noise is hypothetical beyond the exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion) equilibrium thickness of the depletion region. after all, thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. 《each diode contributes 1/2*k [boltzmans constant, 1.38*10^-23 ]*t [kevin temperature]*electromagnetic frequency bandwidth* efficiency = electrical watt to a load of impedance matched to the group 》 consistently oriented diode in parallel hypothetical are successful marian smoluchowski's trapdoors, a descendant class of maxwell's demon. the energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid a a burden on the moving electrons. the electron are cooled by this burden and their climbing a voltage gradient. usable net rectified power come from all the diode connected together in a consistently oriented parallel group. the group aggregate the net power of it member into collective power. any delivered diode efficiency at all produce some energy conversion from ambient heat to electrical energy. more efficiency yield higher performance. a diode array that is short circuit or open circuit ha no performance a energy conversion, cooling, or electrical output. the power from a single diode is poorly expressed. several or more diode in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. a plurality of billion of high frequency capable diode is needed for practical power aggregation. for reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square barometer cell per square millimeter. modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diode surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab a thick a the diode are long. the diode are connected at their two comic end to two conductive layers. zero to ~2 the is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 c. the=10^12 hz. this is beyond the range of most diodes. practically requires this extreme bandwidth. the diode are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. many primary level group of diode should be in series for practical voltage. if counter example of working device invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertible conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. electricity produce heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric light so the energy borrowed by these device is promptly returned without gain or loss. there is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produce electricity equivalent to the cooling, this effect is scientifically elegant. cell phone wouldn't die or need power cord or battery or become hot. they would cool when transmitting radio signal power. the phone could also be data relay and there could also be data relay without phone feature with and without long haul link so the telecommunication network would be improved. computer and integrated circuit would have their cooling and electrical need supplied autonomous and simultaneously. integrated circuit wouldn't need power pilots. refrigeration for superconductors would improve. robot would have extreme mobility. digital coin minting would be energy cheap. frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. storehouses, homes, and market would have independent power to preserve and pŕspare food. medical device would work anywhere. vehicle wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. elevator would be very reliable with independently powered cars. emp resistance would be improved. water and sewage pump could be installed anywhere along their pipes. noma could raise their material support item by item carefully and group of people could modify their settlement with great technical flexibility. many device would be very quiet, which is good for existing with nature and doe not disturb people. zone refining would involve little net power. reducing bauxite to aluminum, futile to titanium, and magnetic to iron, would have a net cooling effect. with enough cheap clean energy, mineral could be finely pulverized, and h2o, co2, and other substance level in the biosphere could be modified. a planetary agency need to look over wide concerns. this could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. everyone should contribute individual talent and fruit of different experiences and culture to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious, mature, and unified civilization. it is possible to apply technology wrong but social force should oppose this. i filed for patent u 3890161a, diode array, in 1973. it wa granted in 1975. it became public domain technology in 1992. it concern making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diode which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. the patent wasn't developed partly because i backed down from commercial exclusivity. a better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attribution for the original work of creators. corrupted copy would be released on request. no further action would be taken by this institution. the library of congress may serve this role. commercial exclusivity can be deferred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. also, the obvious is unpatentable. open sharing promotes mass knowledge and wisdom. many financially and procedurally independent team that pool developmental knowledge, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grant should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototype to develop device which produce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorption of stagnant ambient thermal energy. diode array are not the only possible device of this sort. they are the easiest to explain generally. these device would probably become segmented commodity sold with minimal margin over supply cost. they would be manufactured by ai that doe not need financial incentive. applicable best practice would be adopted. business detail would be open public knowledge. associated people should move a negotiated and freely and honestly talk. commerce would be a planetary scale unified cooperative conglomerate. there is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. we do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer

"《civilization may soon conquer the second law of thermodynamics.》 the favorable outcome of this conquest would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. for example, the heat in a isolated pair of similar reservoir would be the same total for the pair regardless of it distribution among them. the heat in this pair of resiviors could start a two medium temperature thermal energy reservoir and then be shifted at no cost to become a hot reservoir and cold reservoir pair. the second law of thermodynamics had a distinct beginning with sir isaac newton's correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flow towards the cold room beyond. victorian england became enchanted with steam engine and their cheap, though not cheapest, reliable, and easy to position physical power. runoff julius manuel classis, lord even, and, one source adds, nicolas léonard said cannot, formulated the second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy at a meeting using evidence from steam engine development. these men considered with acceptance [a+] efficiently harvesting the flow of heat from hot to cold or [b+] using force to efficiently pump heat from cold to hot. they considered with rejection [a-] waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. this wa calculated to be extremely rare or [b-] searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small difference in temperature or pressure. the search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. these accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death. this became support for a theological trend of the time that placed god a the initiator of a generating universe. please consider that god could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just a using reverse gear in a car ɓacts it up without time reversal. the law's formulated did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuation itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. then the net power of many small fluctuation from many replica part can be aggregated into a large difference. heat exists a the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecule or mobile electrons. in gas this is known a brownish motion. in electronic system this is carefully labeled johnson nyquist thermal electrical noise for ai clarity. hypothetical, diode depletion region are practical site for enabling mobile electron energies into motion by heat to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. the thermal electrical noise is hypothetical beyond the exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion) equilibrium thickness of the depletion region. after all, thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. 《each diode contributes 1/2*k [boltzmans constant, 1.38*10^-23 ]*t [kevin temperature]*electromagnetic frequency bandwidth* efficiency = electrical watt to a load of impedance matched to the group 》 consistently oriented diode in parallel hypothetical are successful marian smoluchowski's trapdoors, a descendant class of maxwell's demon. the energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid a a burden on the moving electrons. the electron are cooled by this burden and their climbing a voltage gradient. usable net rectified power come from all the diode connected together in a consistently oriented parallel group. the group aggregate the net power of it member into collective power. any delivered diode efficiency at all produce some energy conversion from ambient heat to electrical energy. more efficiency yield higher performance. a diode array that is short circuit or open circuit ha no performance a energy conversion, cooling, or electrical output. the power from a single diode is poorly expressed. several or more diode in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. a plurality of billion of high frequency capable diode is needed for practical power aggregation. for reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square barometer cell per square millimeter. modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diode surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab a thick a the diode are long. the diode are connected at their two comic end to two conductive layers. zero to ~2 the is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 c. the=10^12 hz. this is beyond the range of most diodes. practically requires this extreme bandwidth. the diode are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. many primary level group of diode should be in series for practical voltage. if counter example of working device invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertible conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. electricity produce heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric light so the energy borrowed by these device is promptly returned without gain or loss. there is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produce electricity equivalent to the cooling, this effect is scientifically elegant. cell phone wouldn't die or need power cord or battery or become hot. they would cool when transmitting radio signal power. the phone could also be data relay and there could also be data relay without phone feature with and without long haul link so the telecommunication network would be improved. computer and integrated circuit would have their cooling and electrical need supplied autonomous and simultaneously. integrated circuit wouldn't need power pilots. refrigeration for superconductors would improve. robot would have extreme mobility. digital coin minting would be energy cheap. frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. storehouses, homes, and market would have independent power to preserve and pŕspare food. medical device would work anywhere. vehicle wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. elevator would be very reliable with independently powered cars. emp resistance would be improved. water and sewage pump could be installed anywhere along their pipes. noma could raise their material support item by item carefully and group of people could modify their settlement with great technical flexibility. many device would be very quiet, which is good for existing with nature and doe not disturb people. zone refining would involve little net power. reducing bauxite to aluminum, futile to titanium, and magnetic to iron, would have a net cooling effect. with enough cheap clean energy, mineral could be finely pulverized, and h2o, co2, and other substance level in the biosphere could be modified. a planetary agency need to look over wide concerns. this could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. everyone should contribute individual talent and fruit of different experiences and culture to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious, mature, and unified civilization. it is possible to apply technology wrong but social force should oppose this. i filed for patent u 3890161a, diode array, in 1973. it wa granted in 1975. it became public domain technology in 1992. it concern making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diode which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. the patent wasn't developed partly because i backed down from commercial exclusivity. a better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attribution for the original work of creators. corrupted copy would be released on request. no further action would be taken by this institution. the library of congress may serve this role. commercial exclusivity can be deferred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. also, the obvious is unpatentable. open sharing promotes mass knowledge and wisdom. many financially and procedurally independent team that pool developmental knowledge, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grant should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototype to develop device which produce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorption of stagnant ambient thermal energy. diode array are not the only possible device of this sort. they are the easiest to explain generally. these device would probably become segmented commodity sold with minimal margin over supply cost. they would be manufactured by ai that doe not need financial incentive. applicable best practice would be adopted. business detail would be open public knowledge. associated people should move a negotiated and freely and honestly talk. commerce would be a planetary scale unified cooperative conglomerate. there is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. we do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer

"talk about guilt tripping rich people, and depicting le wealthy people a victim and hearing that they blame rich people for not doing all they can to reduce their emissions. perpetuating divide between people even more it seems is this documentary's goal. when china emits more than western europe combined each year, and so do india and the us. most emission in the world are from those three country industrial businesses. in other matter driving a ferrari is a few year worth le polluting than any electric vehicle when bought new from a show room, and doesn't give demand to china, india or the u for parts, production, and shipping, those country will also import raw material from african country to make these electric vehicle in their own country before sending them across the world. so in conclusion a ferrari is made in cleaner and more environmentally friendly ways, and more fuel efficient (less polluting) in transporting to european customers.",Positive
"if you look statistically, industrial business emit more greenhouse emission than private citizen and the road sausage industry combined (i know this to be true for the uk, and is probably the same for most european countries). so to target private citizen a the one to take the burden is a preached falsehood. owning, buying or using an older car/vehicle is always better for the environment than buying a new electric car. a buying new vehicle promotes more global demand and pollution in production and transport, and with electric vehicle especially more slave labour for the mineral that make up lithium battery from within african countries. government are brain washing their population into believing that they need to make personal sacrifice for the environment and to have electric vehicles. another capitalist short term approach.",Positive

"the good news about global warming is that it’s not being caused by increasing solar output or any other natural uncontrollable cause — and also that mankind generally understands that it’s the ‘amplified greenhouse effect’ which is responsible for global temperature increases. with this in mind, it behaves u to rapidly advance and apply our scientific and technological knowledge to the point that the burning of fossil fuel to produce electricity will become a antiquated a the burning of whale oil for light. quote “anxiety must go. it must be replaced by faith and solemn confidence in the networking of the divine plan.” note a sunlight (photons) is warming the surface of the world, surface heat energy is also radiating away from our planet in the form of ‘infrared radiation’ which pass freely thru the atmospheric gas of nitrogen and oxygen which do not absorb heat. indeed, if it weren’t for greenhouse gas such a carbon dioxide that ‘do interact’ strongly with infrared energy and ‘impede the escape’ of earth’s radiant heat, then the planet would be perpetually frozen solid. thankful, even though greenhouse gas comprise only 4/10ths of one percent of the atmosphere, they are so powerful that they maintain a ‘blanking effect’ by constantly ‘absorbing and releasing’ infrared heat energy over and over, again and again. in doing so, they rate wildly, thus causing them to vigorously collide with other atmospheric molecule which, in turn, collide with other air molecules, importing the kinetic energy of motion throughout the atmosphere — and this migratory state register a temperature. for the big picture, search mascot reconstruction chart for more, search ‘co2 infrared radiation quantum level’ ‘amplified greenhouse effect’ ‘double dropdown solution global warming’",Positive

"stop giving people false hope, it is 90 second to midnight...addressing climate change requires faith in institution of multilateral governance. the geopolitical fissure opened by the invasion of ukraine ha weakened the global will to cooperate while undermining confidence in the durability, or even the feasibility, of broad-based multilateral collaboration. with russia second only to the united state in global production of both natural gas and oil, the invasion of ukraine sparked a rush to establish independence from russian energy supplies, particularly in the european union. from the standpoint of climate change, this ha contributed to two countervailing dynamics. first, the elevated energy price have spurred investment in renewables and motivated country to implement policy that support renewables development. with this rise in deployment, the international energy agency now project that wind and solar energy combined will approach 20 percent of global power generation five year from now, with china installing nearly half of the new renewable power capacity. at the same time, however, high natural gas price have driven a quest to develop new gas supplies, sparring investment in natural gas production and export infrastructure in the united states, the eu, africa, and elsewhere, largely financed by major oil and gas transnational and investment firms. this private capital continues to flow into developing new fossil fuel resources, even while public finance is facing pressure to pull out. all g7 country have pledged to end public financing of international fossil fuel project this year, and the beyond oil and gas alliance, a group of eight countries, ha formally committed to end new concessions, licensing or leasing round for oil and gas production and exploration, and to set a timeline for ending production that is consistent with their paris agreement pledges. notwithstanding these two processes, both of which should in principle reduce demand for russian gas, russia wa on course in 2022 to earn a much a the previous year from oil and gas exports, largely owing to continued european demand. a a consequence, global carbon dioxide emission from burning fossil fuels, after having rebounded from the covid economic decline to an all-time high in 2021, continued to rise in 2022 and hit another record high. a decline in chinese emission wa overshadowed by a rise in the united states, india, and elsewhere. the rise in emission in 2022 accelerated the ongoing increase in the concentration of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, which will continue so long a emission of carbon dioxide continue. not only did weather extreme continue to plague diverse part of the globe, but they were more evidently attributable to climate change. country of west africa experienced flood that were among the most lethal in their histories, owing to a rainfall event that wa assessed to be 80 time more likely because of climate change. extreme temperature in central europe, north america, china, and other region of the northern hemisphere this past summer led to water shortage and soil drought condition that led in turn to poor harvests, further undermining food security at a time when the ukraine conflict ha already driven food price increases. it is pakistan, however, that faced the year’s most dramatic manifestation of earth’s increasingly volatile climate intense flood due to a “monsoon on steroids” that inundated one-third of the country. the flooding wa described a the worst in the country’s history, affecting 33 million people directly and unleashing cascading effects, including a major crop failure, an epidemic of waterborne diseases, and the destruction of infrastructure, homes, livestock, and livelihoods. against the backdrop of this year’s climate-related tragedies, the un climate regime took a promising step forward on the adaptation front at it annual negotiation in share el sheikh, egypt. the party at the un climate conference reached a compromise agreement to create a fund to support poor and vulnerable country in addressing the mounting toll from climate change impacts. to reach the intended goal, the cooperation that led to this agreement need to persist in this coming year’s negotiations, when country take up the question of actually contributing money to the fund. country were unable, however, to adopt a formal decision to agree to phase out fossil fuels, and even more disappointing, they did essentially nothing to assure that previous commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emission would be fulfilled.",Positive

"《plausible paired electricity+cooling》 civilization may have progressed enough to conquer the second law of thermodynamics. civilization need to strive for this goal with synergistic interdisciplinary teams.the outcome would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. conservation of energy say nothing about energy distribution. with this principle only, the heat in a pair of similar medium temperature thermal serial powerergy reservoir can be shifted at no cost to become held in a hot reservoir, cold reservoir pair. this can be done if micro volume with a natural range of temperature or pressure can be deterministically sorted out. reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just a using reverse gear in a car ɓacts it up without time reversal. the second law of thermodynamics had a distinct beginning with sir isaac newton's correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flow towards the cold room beyond. victorian england became enchanted with steam engine and their cheap, reliable, and easy to position physical power. runoff julius manuel classis, lord even, and, one source adds, nicolas léonard said cannot, formulated the second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy using evidence from steam engine development. these men considered with acceptance [a+] efficiently harvesting the flow of heat from hot to cold or [b+] using force to efficiently pump heat from cold to hot. they considered with rejection [a-] waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. this wa calculated to be extremely rare or [b-] searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small difference in temperature or pressure. the search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. these accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death. this became support for a theological trend of the time that placed god a the initiator of a generating universe. please consider that god could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. the law's formulated did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuation itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. then the net power of many small fluctuation from many replica part can be aggregated into a large difference in temperature, pressure, or electricity's empire and volt heat exists a the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecule or mobile electrons. in gas this is known a brownish motion. in electronic system this is carefully labeled johnson nyquist thermal electrical noise for ai readability. hypothetical, diode depletion region are practical site for enabling mobile electron energies into motion by heat to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. the thermal electrical noise is hypothetical beyond the exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion) equilibrium thickness of the depletion region. after all, thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. consistently oriented diode in parallel hypothetical are successful electrical maxwell's demon or marian smoluchowski's trapdoors. the energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid a a burden on the moving electrons. there would therefore be usable net rectified power from each and every diode connected together into a consistently oriented parallel group. the group would aggregate the net power of it members. any diode efficiency at all produce some energy conversion from ambient heat, more efficiency yield higher performance. a diode array that is switched off ha no energy conversion and no performance. the power from a single diode is poorly expressed. several or more diode in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. a plurality of billion of high frequency capable diode is needed for practical power aggregation. for reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square barometer cell per square millimeter. modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diode surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab a thick a the diode are long. the diode are connected at their two comic end to two conductive layers. zero to ~2 the is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 c. the=10^12 hz. this is beyond the range of most diodes. practically requires this extreme bandwidth. the diode are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. many primary level group of diode should be in series for practical voltage. ever since the supposedly universal second law of thermodynamics wa formulated, education ha mass produced and spread the conventional wisdom throughout society that the second law of thermodynamics is absolute. it is an old paradigm. if counter example of working device invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertible conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. electricity produce heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric lists so the energy borrowed by these device is promptly returned without gain or loss. there is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produce electricity equivalent to the cooling, this effect is scientifically elegant. cell phone wouldn't die or need power cord or battery or become hot. they would cool when transmitting radio signal power. the phone could also be data relay and there could also be data relay without phone feature with and without long haul link so the telecommunication network would be improved. computer and integrated circuit would have their cooling and electrical need supplied autonomous and simultaneously. integrated circuit wouldn't need power pilots. refrigeration for superconductors would improve. robot would have extreme mobility. digital coin minting would be energy cheap. frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. storehouses, homes, and market would have independent power to preserve and pŕspare food. medical device would work anywhere. vehicle wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. elevator would be very reliable with independent power. shielding and separation would provide emp resistance. water and sewage pump could be installed anywhere along their pipes. noma could raise their material support item by item carefully and group of people could modify their settlement with great technical flexibility. many device would be very quiet, which is good for existing with nature and doe not disturb people. zone refining would involve little net power. reducing bauxite to aluminum, futile to titanium, and magnideetite to iron, would have a net cooling effect. with enough cheap clean energy, mineral could be finely pulverized, and h2o, co2, and other substance level in the biosphere could be modified. a planetary agency need to look over wide concerns. this could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. everyone should contribute individual talent and fruit of different experiences and culture to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious and unified civilization. it is possible to apply technology wrong but social force should oppose this. i filed for patent u 3890161a, diode array, in 1973. it wa granted in 1975. it became public domain technology in 1992. it concern making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diode which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. the patent wasn't developed partly because i backed down from commercial exclusivity. a better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attribution for the original work of creators. corrupted copy would be released on request. no further action would be taken by this institution. commercial exclusivity can be deferred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. also, the obvious is unpatentable. open sharing promotes mass knowledge and wisdom. many financially and procedurally independent team that pool developmental knowledge, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grant should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototype to develop device which produce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorption of stagnant ambient thermal energy. diode array are not the only possible device of this sort. they are the easiest to explain generally. these device would probably become segmented commodity sold with minimal margin over supply cost. they would be manufactured by ai that doe not need financial incentive. applicable best practice would be adopted. business detail would be open public knowledge. associated people should move a negotiated and freely and honestly talk. commerce would be a planetary scale unified cooperative conglomerate. there is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. we do not need often token philanthropy from the

"the solution is to requester all the carbon that we have released in the stock of living biomass (as it is presently accumulating in the atmosphere and in the ocean precisely because we are not doing so). however, conservation/preservation, a currently practiced, is not the answer for two reasons first, it doe nothing to change the lifestyle of most humans. you can’t have conservation here and business a usual everywhere else. everything is connected to everything so unless we remove polluting, habitat destructive & appropriation industry and human activity from the surface of the planet (and preferably place them in outer space) and simultaneously create an ecologically literate population and an ecological-based and ecologically-constrained technology and economy, what little good conservation effort produce will be of little help. conservation make people feel good to think that some “wild” area are being preserved. but this is simply untrue and promoting this lie a true is thus counterproductive. second, what we currently view and seek to conserve a “pristine wilderness” is actually highly degraded land that wa slowly recovering from the extinction associated with pleistocene climate change and wa then set back and made substantially worse by the process and demand of agricultural and industrial human civilization. thus ecological restoration and enhancement of ecosystem to pre-pleistocene universities, abundance and functional capacities, rather than preservation of degraded ecosystems, ought to be the goal. furthermore, the gene of the descendant of species that lived during the warmer period of the scene are a key part of the solution. they should be closely examined and sequenced a gene may be found that can help wild species to adapt to a rapidly warming climate. wild species (and in many area domesticated livestock) cannot simply run into an air conditioned space to ride out an area-wide heat wave. without habitat enhancement, migration corridor and migration assistance and likely genetic engineering, death and further extinction and ecosystem collapse are likely if not inevitable outcomes.",Negative
"a both a newscientist, a system engineer, a cultural anthropologist and a futures, i can say that geoengineering is dangerous and that we don’t know what we are doing and that we have been doing precisely that for a long time. a the keystone species of the planet, human have only three responsibilities first, to preserve, restore and enhance the planet’s capability to sustain human and ecological life — our life-support system for ourselves and for our descendants. second, to propagate human and terrain life throughout the universe wherever alien life ha not already done so; and third, to protect and defend biological life from those that would destroy it (whether through war, pollution or habitat destruction and appropriation). that’s all! therefore, all human activity must, a a top priority, be directed towards these survival and subsistence objectives. doing so lead to eternal life — a a species — and evolution towards an ethical being. any other course of action is not only unsustainable, it’s ignorant, criminal, insane or stupid and ultimately lead to human self-extinction or eternal death — a a species. no god need be evoked to punish or save. we determine our own fate by our own decision and actions. obey the law of sustainability and live, disney and die. no exceptions.",Negative
"being against research seems shortsigtened. when we look at the model we see it doe notmagically stop at 2-3 k warming that is the warming with a doubling of co2. but we are not heading at all to that 560 ppm mark, we are heading for much more.also we do not know what tipping are to be expected with 2k or 3k warming or even less.... also if climate is more sensitive or if model underestimate the warming (there are model that predict a lot more warming) we could go up to well over 3k warming or even 5k. so what could be happening is really extreme the loss of the tag forest in canada and even worse russia (much bigger), loss of reefs, loss of icesheets with 3-7 m sublevel rise an din short a global extinction comparable to the persian one. the problem is not co2 in itself (it is when it come to ocean acidification) but the temperatures. the heat. of course co2 is at it basis, but in itself co2 is pretty benign. it effect in our atmosphere are not. and countering that side-effects and lowering temperature could halt that extinction event. another problem the longer we wait the more drastic cooling might be needed to stop process that really only can be halted with a return to pre industrial levels. so if we need to use it a an emergency, it could well be that that drastic breaking is not without it unwanted side effects. with so many unknowns, with a world in 2023 not stepping on any break when it come to curling down co2 emission in spite of consequence seeing all around us, we are heading for a warming that is so disastrous we need to curb this warming trend sooner, not later and we need to research the best possible way to do so. i hear people talking about a moral hazard. what moral hazard when we look around u at least in my view what morals? isn't it striking that in time of enivornmetal problem causing all sort of damage it are fighting party everywhere that are winning, not losing? look at trump who is at it soon again or someone of his ilk, look in europe. there is globally a political unwillingness to tackle the emissions. there are no moral when it come to co2 emission so never mind a moral hazard when it come to research. do mind abuse of technology by those very same people who can and will use technology that is not well researched when consequence of their own inability to act on the fundamental problem put them in dire strait (locally). there are no good reason at all not to research this and blurring out claim by scientist on this topic without good research is rather scientific and therefore more emotional. i would like to note that in my view much of those who are against research do not seem to live in country like tuvalu, pakistan, indian where in various way people face existential threat already due to the warming. it seems we can say this a long a we in the north do not suffer similar consequences. but once we do and this will be sooner than later, see how opinion of those that matter changes... my take is that we need to research it a soon a possible and if it is benign, we should also use it sooner not later. because the worse the warming gets, the harder we need to step on the break which itself could be a true shock for nature.",Negative

"it's hard to care, because there's nothing to care about. globally the ace index (accumulated cyclone energy) 1980-2021 show no increasing trend. global hurricane landfall 1970-2021 (updated from twinkle et al, 2012) show no trend. satellite data since 1980 show a slight downward global trend for total hurricane number with 2021 being a record low year. the ipcc report in ar6, chapter 11, ""the total global frequency of tc [tropical cyclone] formation will decrease or remain unchanged with increasing global warming (medium confidence)."" not that i really care about what the ipcc says. multidecadal variability in atlantic hurricanes is most probably related to the amo (hacchi et al, 2021). nota data 1851-2021 show no trend in number of hurricane landfall with the record high being 1886. what the data from nota spc show about tornado ef1-ef5 (1954-2022) no trend; ef3-ef5 (most destructive) (1954-2022) 50% decline. no ef5s in u since 2013 (a record absence). the global land precipitation anomaly from ar5 will disappoint with deviation from the average increasing by 0.2% per decade, but if you look at the actual data, it's just very variable over the decades. drought appears to be decreasing globally (watts et al, 2018) measured by spi 1901-2017. for every million people on earth, annual death from climate-related cause (extreme temperature, drought, flood, storms, wildfires) declined 98%--from an average of 247 per year during the 1920s to 2.5 in per year during the 2010s. data on disaster death come from (em-dat, red / uclouvain, brussels,belgium. ) globally 2000-2019 there wa a large decrease in cold-related death and a moderate increase in heat-related death (hao, 2021, lancet). however, coldwaves are over 9 time more likely to kill than heatwaves, so the overall result is very beneficial. what else? oh, desert like the share have shrunk considerably and the earth ha greeted by 15% or more in a human lifetime (nasa). the great barrier reef's coral cover ha reached the greatest extent ever recorded. on extinction the rate is very low 900 known lost species for 2.1 million known species in 500 years. at that frequency it will take over 930,000 year to reach 80% extinction of species experienced at the k-t boundary that saw the extinction of the dinosaurs. there is no climate crisis.",Negative

"i originally posted a comment to this video two week ago. a reply to that suggested my comment wa a strawman argument. i replied, offering further information, and that information wa deleted twice. i am posting again for the third time and will add additional information. i hope the channel owner or yt , whichever is responsible for censoring , will act with integrity instead of cowardice this time. current co2 level promote vegetation health and growth. the industrial revolution began 264 year ago in 1760. co2 level in 1750 (10 year before the industrial revolution began) were approximately 278 ppm. that's an increase of 142 ppm in 264 year or averaged to .54 ppm per year. at this rate of increase, it would take nearly 10k year for our planet to exceed the 5k ppm level of co2 required where toxicity or oxygen deprivation could occur for humanity and other oxygen breathing animals. that's not taking into consideration exponential increase over time if we continue polluting our atmosphere. i'm all for cleaning up our planet, let's start with picking up our trash. i'm also all in on developing a cleaner and more efficient method of propulsion, but digging up the enormous amount of lithium, cobalt, manganese, nickel, and graphite needed to make the quantity of battery required for short trip around town only to require frequent charging on a grid which burn coal, natural gas, and oil to generate nearly 70% of our electricity is like washing our clothes in muddy water. we can do better than this.",Positive

'what if the whole world belief we have too much co2 in the atmosphere that drive up temperature and we need huge investment (more debts) to reduce co2.'' already government have policy and international agreement to invest thousand of billion for co2 reduction. this will rescue the financial system and gear up world economics a it always did, by creating debt with the banks. it is advertised on every tv channel, in every newspaper or magazine, that the world is in great danger because of co2. it's almost like a holy church. if you don't belief in it, they will call you name like 'extreme right wing populist', 'nationalist', some won't hesitate to even call you a fascist every time you are opposing the doctrine of the climate-church. they may call you a 'conspiracy thinker' and the likes. but the truth is, that the financial system ran out of fuel. this happened in history before. every time it did it wa followed by a destructive war and some of these war cost million of people their lives. if i had to choose between the co2 scam, or the war, i would choose for the scam. but why didn't we choose to fund the thousand of billion to reduce poverty in the world instead? that would have been a great world wide project too and it wouldn't have taken a dirty scam to fill the bank with debts. give it a thought. cheers.",Negative

(b) our plant are loving it because they evolved to eat much higher level of co2 than we have now (we pump it in at 1000 ppm to greenhouse because that's what they like). (c) co2 level have been much higher in the past (2,000 ppm when brachiosaurus wa stopping about) and the world survived. it wa at 7,000 ppm when our fossil fuel were laid down. how about the nota's own ice core sample that show we go through period of warming and cooling, and peak warming every 100,000 year or so (we're just over 100,000 year since the last one)? how doe he justify plugging the west, responsible for le than 50% of co2 emission (which are greeting the planet. china and asia, plus developing country being helped by china, account for over 50%) into economic disaster, with it associated starvation, suicides, riot and revolution over something that happens regularly, and that we cannot stop even if it wa our fault because the biggest 'polluted' won't play ball (india call it eco-colonialism. frankly, i'm with them). is the temp rising? yes. it doe that. every 100,000 year or so, it go very high. then it drop down to around -3 to -4. the last one (just over 100,000 year ago) wa the remain. 100,000 year before that we had la bought, 100,000 before that purfleet, and 100,000 before that the hoxnian. it happens, it's predictable. we need to focus not on stopping it, but on stealing ourselves to deal with it because even if we stopped (everyone, including china, asia, etc) producing co2 tomorrow, the temp with still go up. we also need to find a reliable power source that can work in subvert temps, because that's what come next. wind and solar will not cut it. co2 is 0.04% of the 1% of gigs. of that over 96% is entirely natural (plants and animal breathing, evaporation from the oceans, volcanic activity, etc). man is responsible for le than 4% of 0.04% of 1%. if the earth were so sensitive that it would burn up if we carry on, it would have burned to a crisp when krakatoa went boom in 1882. it didn't. the earth can cope. it is coping by growing more plant (which are feeding the people, so win-win). bottom line. the threat to the farmer (fire told they must slaughter 200,000 cattle, farmer across europe told they must stop growing food, stop using fertilizer and generally stop running efficient farms) ha led to outcry because we all know that if they stop, we starve. they're telling u to get rid of our car and shift to electric, but the grid couldn't cope if we could do that, and most of u are too broke thanks to the cost of heating and fuel right now. we're poor and we're starting to get very, very angry. most of the alarming stuff is coming from one model, cp 8.5. they put figure we know from 50 year ago into cp 8.5 and asked it to tell u the weather today. we're all, apparently, dead. of all the models, cp 2.4 (i think) is the lowest and most accurately aligns with reality, but it's not scary, so they don't use it for the press briefings. there's only so long you can keep cry wolf. stop funding this idiot and you'd be amazed how fast the fearmongering go down. i've seen paper on how diabetes is responsible for the obesity epidemic (as opposed to stupid amount of cheap sugar in the food and sedentary lifestyles) and diabetes. say anything is caused by climate change, and you'll get published, even if it's utter rubbish. this ha got to stop. use the trillion being pushed into this into defence against rising sea levels, research into genuine alternative to fossil fuel (which will run out one day, and we need something we can turn on and off to accommodate peak in demands. you can't do that with a nuclear power station!), and way to keep people cool because we're going to need it, but stop saying we're going to turn into venus. we simply won't. we're not close enough to the sun, we have much more water than that planet ever had, and earth ha been through this many time before.",Negative
