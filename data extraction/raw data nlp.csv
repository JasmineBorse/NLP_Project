"Sea level rise is already baked in, water front property for sale in Seattle."
"And remember, it's your fault,with your soggy wet paper straw..."
I never heard so much bullshit in my life…a recent study found at least 138 volcanoes under the ice in west Antarctica maybe this might cause it to melt now and again??? Climate bullshit
Now what?
can't we make it happen sooner? I won't be able to enjoy it AFTER my lifetime.
Look an Brain     -------------------------------------->    🧠
So when will sea levels start to rise?? We are all waiting for Obama’s beach side mansion to fall into the ocean!!!😅😅😅
"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Who writes this bollox, it's all lies lies lies"
Keep feeding the agenda lol
All I'm going to say is #ClimateScam
Ich bin begeistert von dieser Kreativität!👄
Let it melt let it melt let it melt 😂😂😂
Wow! A whole report based around “could”. Absolutely fantastic journalism.
I thought africa needned more water
"1:57 ""they're getting increasingly confident in saying extreme weather events are INFACT due to man made climate change"" ""hear they don't know for sure"" ""but it's the FACT there are so many other aspects of Antarctica that's under stress seeing these extreme events that makes them pretty confident"" 😂👏 what an oxymoron if I've ever heard one spoken broadcast on the news 😅 ""Infact"" ""don't know for sure"" ""fact""
What a bunch of gobbledygook 😆"
😂😂😂😂😂😂
More WEF crap from Skynews.
Good news.
Funny I just looked and they say the sea ice has been getting bigger over the last 40 years
"Remember during Covid, a news boss said once Covid is over we’ll be pushing climate change"
Not in our lifetime 👍🏽 good
The arctic circles ice has grown 15 miles in the past 20 years. Don’t believe the global warming scare mongering
"Absolute garbage, it'll all be frozen back over in the next few months 😂"
"If there is one place on the planet where we can block the sun, it would be Antarctica."
"Isn't the edge of the earth around somewhere there any way, so if the ice is becoming a problem we can just push it all off the edge."
"Do people really believe this utter nonsense ? looking at the dramatic downturn in Sky News figures, possibly not"
Emphasis on weasel word 'may'....
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Everyone enjoying the 'global boiling' and the 'climate change' this August in Britain, enjoying that 15°c and non stop rain?
If the these mainstream media liars reported on water being wet I would still be skeptical and go double check myself.
Zero faith in these corporate puppets."
Just stop heating ! No?
"Oh, they don't have many weather stations down there, so how did they measure average global temperature, which they reported last week was the highest in 120,000 years? Oh yeah, that's right, it was based on a model!"
"Well, I guess the fats in the fire ---Can't wait for fall and winter .. This earth has always been a magical mystery we have no control over .."
I got married in 1975 Oct 25th it was a hot sunny day glorious the same as Oct in 2023 it was maybe a little hotter in the north of England .The glaziers are melting they always have since the Ice Age it is what ice does it Melts. The weather is all over the place that is because Governments like China / America are using chemical from planes leaving chem trails to disrupt weather patters its a bio war against each other to disrupt countries and sometimes they drift in the atmosphere over countries that they were not intended for. The reason Climate Change was voice is it raises taxes against companies i.e wrapping. waste. petrol anything that Governments can raise money on. WAKE UP PEOPLE get real stop being sheep led by the nose and following world Government misinformation indoctrination.
"LIES !!!!!!   The future is COLD, not hotter....."
"I,m wondering if the planet has an automatic cycly from iceage to a hot climate and that vulcanos become more active till a big one blast enough dust in the air that blocks sunlight to reset earth into new iceage..."
🤣.
How come tou never hear a sky news or any other news reporter freaking out over these fearing headlines? I mean surely if they are telling people constant bad news it must effect them mentally?
"Global Cooling, Man Made Climate Change, Global Warming, Climate Change, Global Boiling, and the next made up Marxist word will be Global Melting. lol, all fake pushed by the fascist media and governments.."
"Another climate propaganda video. Antarctic ice sheet mass loss is about 90 Gt/yr (Otosaka et al, 2023). It's total mass is 24 million Gt, so it loses less than 0.0004% of its mass annually. It contributes 0.36mm to sea-level rise per year (that's pitiful). At the current rate it will take well over ¼ million years to melt, but we are due for two more glacial periods in that time. The ice is here to stay."
Total bull and fear mongering.
बर्फ पिघल रही है देश एक दूसरे पर आरोप-प्रत्यारोप कर रहे है पर कोई यह नहीं सोच रहा अगर बर्फ के पहाड़ पिघल गए तो दुनिया के बहुत से देश समुद्र की गोद में समा जाएंगे
Stop playing with our climate and it will go back to normal.
"About time people realised this,plus as the ice melts it releases Methane which i worse than carbon."
"If so much ice has melted, where’s the water level rise for this year?"
"Yeah alot of talk for many years about a possible blue ocean event in the arctic, but it seems like we will have a blue ocean event in the antarctica first, and it could happen already next year.  The sea ice for this time of the year is like 1,8  millions of square kilometers sea ice lesser than last year,  if that hold up til march next year, than the it is not just a blue ocean event we will see, the sea ice will then be completely gone.  But we are not there yet, but a blue ocean seems very likely next year, it feels more like with how big of a margin it will be a blue ocean event ( a blue ocean event is when it is lesser than 1 millions of square kilometers sea ice)."
I dont care about climate change.
What about the GDP of New Queensland??? 🇭🇲
Most sci-fi films end up with some truth and I’m fairly confident the human race has truly ruined its own eco system that the film “ day after tomorrow “ will eventually occur
The truly ignorant are still saying it’s just the weather.
"I'm perplexed what even was that? Next on Sky News scientists say "" infact fire cold hot cold not sure but fact fire cold hot 😅"
Antarctica 😂it dosen even exist 😂just a ice wall all the way around and the dome 😂 #vibes of cosmos youtube..❤
"the biggest thing heating up the ground temp is our black roads and roofs make them all while/light grey and it will reflect more of the sun just like the ice caps, cant belive this hasnt been talked about at all"
"The Bronze Age Collapse, collapse of Babylonian, Persian, Greek and Roman civilizations, near extinction events, cyclical climate change, man made climate change, Book of Revelation and ancient doomsday genre and so forth might be aggregated as a field of study to make modern systems more robust.The Bronze Age collapse, which occurred around 1200 BCE, was caused by a combination of several factors. While the exact reasons may vary in different regions, some of the major contributing factors include:

Invasions and migrations: Various groups, such as the Sea Peoples, invaded and attacked the established civilizations, causing widespread destruction and destabilization.

Internal unrest and conflicts: Many civilizations faced internal struggles, including social unrest, economic disparities, and political upheavals, weakening their structures from within.

Economic disruptions: The collapse of trade networks and disruptions in resource acquisition led to economic instability, affecting the prosperity of the ancient societies.

Climate change and natural disasters: Environmental factors, including droughts, famines, earthquakes, and other natural calamities, played a role in destabilizing societies and making them more vulnerable to external pressures.

Collapse of centralized authority: The fall of powerful empires and centralized authorities left regions fragmented and susceptible to external invasions and internal strife.

Technological shifts: The advent of iron technology may have provided a competitive advantage to certain groups, leading to the decline of bronze-dependent civilizations.

It's important to note that the Bronze Age collapse was not a singular event but rather a complex and interconnected series of events that resulted in the decline and disappearance of several ancient civilizations. The specific combination and significance of these factors varied across different regions, leading to the end of the Bronze Age and shaping the subsequent history of the ancient world.

"@Sky News - this needs to be shouted from the rooftops. We are going to destroy civilization if we don't fix CO2 emissions ASAP. The AMOC collapse paper (gulf stream stopping) is pure nightmare fuel. Europe would go back into an ice age. We need to stop climate change NOW or there will be no future, no humanity, civilization will collapse."
Nice to see Rob Brydon’s slightly better-looking brother presenting for Sky. 👍
And some people STILL deny climate change and many governments are still expanding fossil fuel use. Total insanity.

"Wow! Are people still falling for this bollox? First, it was the greenhouse effect, then it was the hole in the ozone, then global warming, and now its climate change. Don't forget to get your 5th vaccine shot, Grauniad readers."
"So the UN SG doesn't read his own UN-funded IPCC reports. This is what IPCC AR6 Chapter 11 on Extreme Weather says about the weather. These are direct quotes.
On floods: “Low confidence for observed changes in the magnitude or frequency of floods at the global scale.”

On droughts: “There is medium confidence that since the 1950s some regions of the world have experienced a trend to more intense and longer droughts … but in some regions droughts have become less frequent, less intense, or shorter…”. [Thus, no global trend in droughts, but an increase in some regions and a decrease in others.]

Hurricanes/Tropical cyclones: 
”There is low confidence in observed long-term trends in hurricane intensity, frequency, and duration, and any observed trends in phenomena such as tornadoes and hail.”
“Data corresponding to hurricanes that have directly impacted the United States since 1900 are considered to be reliable, and show no trend in the frequency of U.S. landfall events”
“Data representing hurricane landfall frequency over Australia show a decreasing trend in eastern Australia since the 1800s as well as in other parts of Australia since 1982.”

Extra tropical storms [ie. major storms outside of the tropics]. 
“there is overall low confidence in recent changes in the total number of storms over both hemispheres”
“Overall, there is also low confidence in past-century trends in the number and intensity of the strongest storms”

So where, in that, is there evidence that ""climate change is out of control""?

It's interesting and disappointing that The Guardian prefers to quote the mis-informed non-expert who doesn't even read his own organisation's reports (except of course the Summary BY Policymakers) rather than do its own 'investigative journalism' of actually reading what the 'consensus science' says. 

It would be the equivalent for the supposed Exxon scam of 'already knowing about climate change' as if The Guardian only quoted the CEO and ignored any other evidence. Would they do that? Of course not. Their actions and investigative efforts are driven by the agenda they want to present rather than the truth."
"Humanity as a whole is ok with the world getting worse for us, that's why there is hardly any action.

"Meanwhile, in China and India, the completion of over 200 coal burning plants is due by the end of the year. The number of coal burning plants in the UK? : 0"

"There has recently been the hottest day ever.
Not surprising, as this graph shows that the entire Earth has warmed by 4 degrees Centigrade since January.
The temperature of the Earth on Jan 1. 2023 was 13.14 degrees C
and the temperature of the Earth on July 7 2023 was 17.20 degrees.
Which is a rise in global warming of 4.06 degrees in only 6 months.
That's a very frightening number."
"well obviously no one in power is going to do anything about it and they never were, ""climate action"" has become a joke, the only thing to do now is to prepare to survive extreme climate instability and social chaos. but the rich countries and wealthy people have a plan to survive. they have massive control of weapons and resources and armies and power. they thought ahead and made lots of wealth out of destroying the planet so they can survive. so whats the problem? solution: just make several hundred million dollars and you should be personally ok."

"The UN is out of control.
More than 4,000 years ago in Mesopotamia – the area currently made up of Iraq, north-east Syria and south-east Turkey – the Akkadian empire ruled supreme. Until a 300-year-long drought quite literally turned all their plans to dust. It was part of a pattern of changing climate conditions in the Middle East around 2,200 BCE that was constantly disrupting life and up-ending emerging empires."

The right answer is a prosperous and sustainable future based on magma energy; a source of energy so vast it can supply world energy demand carbon free plus power desalination, irrigation, recycling and carbon capture into the long term future. The UN are uniquely placed to recommend magma energy to the world - a global solution to a universal threat."

When will it be ready? 

Keep in mind that this must be done worldwide. Also keep in mind that overall energy consumption in 2050 will be 50% more than it was in 2020.

What happens when it’s too windy?

"Climate change has nothing to do with auto exhaust or emissions. There has been a substantial increase in seismic and volcanic activity over the last hundred years. This has increased the temperature of the land, sea, and air. The weather is most likely changing back to what it was 2,000 years ago. When the Romans were in Britain (40BC-380AD) they grew citrus fruit in the north. Look up ""Roman Warm Period"" and ""Medieval Warm Period"" online. It appears that there is a major change every 1,000 years and that is where we are today. Periodic change in the heat, light, and radiation created by the sun affects the earth both above and below and is the cause of the global warming we are experiencing."
In the 1970's the same people were saying that we were headed for the next Ice Age.  It's just summer people.

"Every time I hear of complaints concerning the high price being paid at the pump, along with the high price of heating oil, I think of our failure to end the use of fossil fuels, or at least curtailing their general use.

During the last 70 years temperatures have risen another 1.5c or combined since 1850 are about 3.0c. Most environmentalist now believe 8c to 12c temperature rise are possible within 20 years due to Methane rich areas in Siberia and in the Oceans that are now melting into a GAS State rising into the Atmosphere. *(World Temp could be on avg over 120 Degree & up most places on the planet if they are correct.)*

Is China one of these  24 counties? If not maybe we should bring our businesses back to America
The first thing you have to do is overthrow the government of the Earth our leaders are on a suicidal mission to use all fossil fuels until the minute we die we are in a war they will not stop are you going to stop them or are you just going to f****** sit there until they burn down the planet or we die in nuclear Holocaust as they fight over the last resources
humanity will inevitably die of stupidity and greed.
The carbon footprint was trees grow 5 feet taller now
"Yes, protect nature & get off fossil fuels.  But mechanical carbon capture is largely unfeasible, unless it's done let's say at a waste to energy facility and put right into basaltic rock.  Practical solutions exist, such as converting farms to grazing, less meat, more forest protection, marine protection.  I would put more weight in lowering the amount of sunlight striking the earth by spreading limestone dust in the upper atmosphere or space around the planet, and letting forests and prairies slowly absorb CO2 then capture it in biomass on a slightly less sunny planet.  We've already got momentum, so dusting near space may be necessary.. 🌏🌍🌍🏐"
"Lmao
Another fictitious climate report to promulgate an agenda."
Nobody on the screen is doing anything to significantly reduce their carbon footprint. It's time to panic if so inclined.
A battery powered dynamo power an electric motor is an unlimited range electric cars or truck.  They are very inexpensive to build and operate.  You don't have to recharge a battery.  The dynamo powers the car and recharges the battery.  If you were military vehicles or an airplane an Edison generator should be installed as backup if the vehicle is hit with microwave radiation.
Start with preventing those stupid recreation trips to “outer space”. Bezos.
"The Earth is cooler w atmos/GHGs/albedo not warner.
To perform as advertised the GHGs require ""extra"" energy upwelling from the surface radiating as a black body.
The kinetic heat transfer processes of the contiguous atmos molecules render such a scenario impossible.
No greenhouse effect, no GHG warming, no man/CO2 driven climate change."
"It’s never… good grief look at the overpopulated world.. then Russia attack of Ukraine 🇺🇦, Syria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Brazil’s rain forest or anywhere in the world. It seems maybe containment of suffering would be also something to look at."
"This chuckling buffoon is trivializing an existential threat!  One might think that the movie ""Don't Look Up"" was a farce now I see it as a documentary."
I don’t believe anything is doomed.
Guys I'd love to do something about global warming but it's time for world war III baby are tanks and jet fighter fumes good for the environment no but God damn is it fun at least we're going out in a blaze of glory guys global warming what are you guys talking about we're going to have a nuclear war it's going to be hot all right try the temperature of the Sun but we'll have the global warming s*** under control now that we're going to invent this drifting new technology called the sorrowfield ashes of billions of dead people floating in the atmosphere after a nuclear Holocaust oh that s*** will cool the environment right down but hey I tell you guys what I've been saying this the entire time there's still time now the government's going to tell you to go die in wars and starve you with hyperinflation and we all know global warming is real can't you see you're all going to die anyway but if we're going out let's go out on our own terms we still the politicians the people doing this s*** the billionaires we know who they are we know where they are if we all collectively got together and just attacked what chance could they possibly have of course a lot of us will die but a lot of us are going to starve meaninglessly and then they'll win anyway same s*** that Hitler said I don't offer you peace I offer you blood fire death and Glory
Put a CO2 monitor in your living room and you’ll soon understand what the real problem is. Too many mammals breathing causes the stats to rise. Multiply times 8 billion humans plus their furry friends . That’s 7 billion more humans than in the year 1904. Just ponder that.
Mining for rare earth metals needed for green energy emits enormous amounts of co2. And green energy required massive amounts of deforestation.
Talk talk take.world never fix anything.
"The climate is going to change no matter what the UN does.  The UN climate goals are a scam now teamed up with the WEF pushing the great reset by 2030.  Prepare to be hypnotized, terrorized, and brainwashed by your authoritarian climate overlords."
"""Protect nature” -Clear cuts trees for solar."
"The reporter laughing while reporting on ""we're all doomed"" topic lol :)"
I'm with Tanya. We have GOT to be optimistic. We have GOT to implement critical changes. We have actual can save ourselves from doom. We just have to DO IT.
One sure fire way to cut emissions would be a nuclear war.
Drill baby drill
Out of time ....
Lmfao
"I'm with Tony on this one. My expectation is that humanity will do nothing to prevent the worst case scenario and we'll end up suffering horrible consequences. All the rich elites will be fine though since they'll be able to pump purified air into their underground fortresses, the rest will be left to fight for survival in a dystopian hellscape. Sounds delightful."
Any countries that have the technology to power the world 🌎 without but they just don't care because a huge rock is headed towards the Earth 🌎 and NASA says it's going to pass us by so close that it could take out most of the lower sattilites but what they didn't tell you is they are wrong and in April 13  2029 a huge rock just like the Bible says it will break into three pieces So Cal and Mexico and the Pacific ocean in the ocean the mantle will be cracked there will be numerous tsunamis that will be of tremendous size you can figure out the rest the whole coast line around the Pacific ocean will be wiped out this is not a joke 777
Everyone in the comments is still asleep
What a lie.
I choose never
You're so full of crap. Isn't it amazing it's only the US that needs to cut all their emissions. None of the other countries especially China the worst one is doing a damn thing.
"How much are the white west paying to the global south to prevent the catastrophie? After all the major consumers in the world are white western people that has led to this situation. This is a racial war and the white west now realises the damage it has caused to the planet after centuries of exploitation, colonisation, imperialism and the domination of the global south and now wants to limit the development of people of color in the global south without contributing substantially towards combating climate change by continuing to dominate the world."
We can keep throwing money at politicians to save us. That should work.
Thank you Europe 4 Mercantile capitalism
Meanwhile Joe Manchin is clutching his dirty coal pearls.
"Reducing global greenhouse gas emissions is a euphemism or a nice way of saying depopulation/population control. Agenda 2030 is fast approaching sheeple. You can side with good or you can choose evil, that's if you're still alive to make that choice. Either way currently it's The Great Reset vs. The Great Awakening. The anti-human New World Order agenda is in full swing now."
The only people who will suffer are those living on the coast or small islands. Nothing can be done because the people in charge won’t change.
"😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 
We could also collect gold at the end of a rainbow."
Phase out fossil fuels by 2100
"People with the power to actually do something be screaming ""oh no, not the economy!""😱 🙄🥴☠️"
"I’m sick of hearing about the climate. Some areas will have  problems and other areas will benefit from it. In either case, I will be dead before it happens."
It look like Russia is start of making warming climate worse.  And if there is world war three we will be killing ourselves both ways
Apocalypse never is a good book for anyone interested in the propaganda surrounding human caused global warming.
"Human overshoot is still being ignored, it's too personal."
Defund the UN.
"We had better get a move on with those nuclear power stations, the next mini ice age started a few years ago, is speeding up rapidly. Once large amounts of cold water flood out of Antartica, the ocean's circulation will stop. The ice age can then happen almost ovenight. No more Gulf Steam for Europe. Expect famine, war and disease. By 2030, or sooner, it will be here. Nothing we can do except try and survive, Get your weapons ready to protect your property and food. Grow you own as much as you can if possible. There will be no electricity as the grid will be fried by plasma bursts in a couple of years caused by the electromagnetic reversal of the planet."
He said “protect nature” but what he meant was “switch to a plant based diet”. Super annoying that he wasn’t direct about it.
"Lads seriously... when are we going to call the ""real"" problem...
Junkies are not going to change the habits of a lifetime.
That's also true for carbon junkies.
What's happening with Russian gas should be all the proof of that fact anyone would need.
Anyway, the 'real' problem isn't ""carbon"" it's ""people"" way too many of them for the planet to support.
What's needed here is a good old fashioned war ( a big one )...now hold that though...a ""solution""  might be on its way.
What ya really think the 1% are just going to sit it out...I don't think so...
Like what's the point of squealing all those billions and don't live to spend it?...
Seriously you're that naive?"
Nobody can change this warming right NOW!
"Well, the War in the Ukraine isn’t helping either."
"they said same thing 40 years ago, 30 years ago, and they will still say it in one century, but the problem men cannot change sun cycle who is at the basis of climate cycles..."
climate change my a... its bs theres no climate change i have a picture of me as a baby setting in yard in middle of February the year 1986 guess what it was very warm then in winter climate working the way god intended get off this bs talk you all have been brainwashed its not heating up because of carbon its heating up up cause my god the good lord is working mother nature people 😂😂😂😂😂😂 you crazies
Limit global warming everyone🙏✊'❤🌍🌎✌
Lol we're going extinct soon
It’s over we dead
"All BS!!!!    All fear mongering here.   FJB.  Its all about the money, donate and the Elites get richer."
The sky was so blue during covid lockdown.
"95% of atmospheric CO2 is from decaying vegetation, 2% at most from fossil fuels.
Even MIT states leaves alone contribute 90%.

So, if atmospheric CO2 is a crisis, what's the plan to stop plants from rotting UN ""scientists""?

FYI, per the UN, we had 12 years to live in 1999."
"How about we at least shift to being ""green"" by RECYCLING."" It doesn't cost any money at all, and I believe most of us have learned that since the first or second grade. ( The only obstacle is not getting our butts up to put in the recycling bin.) We still need to use use renewable energy in the long-run though.☀💧💧⚡⚡"
They want Sunday inactivity and mandatory Sunday worship to fight the clim ate cr isis ---> Sunday Law. That's the mark of the beast.
"Dearest Cbs, climate change? 
1. Carbon is our friend of mine actually
2. Actual facts and common sense one day shall rule.
3. This change that you twist and not very well. Is like magician. Let me explain well like senator Kennedy fROM Louisiana, funny as heck with his quips..ONLY THESE JOKES..keeps him in the Senate..

You are the same holding up one hand saying look at this look at this, while you take the other hand and pull money out of OUR POCKETS WITH THE OTHER.."
You can start by stop making China the bogeyman.  Can you do that?  Or you gonna listen to the old farts in the senate that will be dead either which way?
Global warming is because of all the nuclear testing  the Russians subs China's subs  us subs... are sending to the north and south ...
"Jesus Christ saves from sin.
Romans 3: 23
For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
Hebrews 9: 27 
And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
Isaiah 64: 6 
But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
Revelation 21: 8
But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

Romans 5: 8 
But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
John 3: 16 
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
John 14: 6
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

Romans 10: 9-10. 
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
Jesus said John 5: 24 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.

1John 5: 10-13
He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God..

Ephesians 2: 8-9 
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.
Romans 8: 1 
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
1 Corinthians 15: 3-4
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
2 Corinthians 5: 21
For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him...."
My school said something about this today
What is funny?!
"Don't buy cars made by Audi, because they are the greatest polluters on production and on use! 😬"
"The real problem will be production, distribution and storage of grains, vegetables and meats at scale and scope, once that breaks down, and it is already starting, Chaos will ensue. Then the 450 global nuclear plants start burning spent fuel rods and go all Chernobyl on anything left. ""The only existential question left is how we will choose to wait out the finale. But to pose that question is to defy the cultural mania for hope, the yearning for collective self-delusion. If reality is grim, you banish it. You invent impossible scenarios of inevitable salvation. Which explains how we ended up where we are."" ~Chris Hedges"
Breaking news: report comes out stating that the weather is gonna weather
The earth is millions of years old and goes through warming and cooling periods you climate clowns.
Really like all the comments. The gov  needs to close up shop on the climate change bull
This is the same lies and agenda they been pushing since 1969. Back then it was a new ice age. Don’t go for it. This is just the way government gets people to give them more power and take away our rights. Death by a thousand cuts.
The sky is falling! You folks are so credulous. And people keep moving to Phoenix -- how about that.
Climate Change: When you want unlimited funding for an issue that you can't fix and never have to show positive results for all the money spent
"Al Gore said this would happen by 2020. So like, add another 25 years?"
All these lies.  Climate goes through changes and cycles.  Hoax that cost us a lot of money.
Climate is been changing for million years way before human. Arizona use to be a big ocean. Funky scientists.
"$150 billion every 3 weeks,  wow that is $2.6 trillion a year or about $4000 per person per year in USA. How about government gives us each a $2000 dollar check, every year we cut back enough to reduce weather events? Would be cheaper and a nice incentive to cut-back"
What a load of hogwash.
Climate change. Is BS and a waste of resources. It’s a excuse to take tax dollars and fund the government.
B.S.
This is democrats supported bs
Oh No!  We are all going to die unless we listen to people who fly private jets everywhere!
"So, in the past 500 years, why has plymouth rock remained at sea level? Is climate change actually changing anything other than who's pockets are getting fatter? What ever happened to acid rain? Or the rainforest being over harvested? Or how about China dumping millions of tons of chemicals into the ocean? No, still in denial?"
Really?  Who believes this stuff?
So is that why all politicians and rich people buy oceanfront property because the oceans are rising come on you? People stop with the lying and the scare tactics and the fake weather
The Arial spraying is causing the Atmosphere to HEAT UP.   climate change is a GLOBALIST CONSPIRACY THEORY.   How much Co2 is in the Atmosphere?    WAKE ⏰️ up ⏰️ PEOPLE
Someone should tell the volcanoes to stop going off their causing more global warming.
ooooooo im so scared but all these idiots that are warning us are still buying beach houses so i call bull crap
"who to believe these people or the creator of the weather channel 🤔 
lmfao its gona get cold real cold"
More democratic fear-mongering
We're all going to die anyways
They've been saying this since the 70's and is the biggest lie and nothing but a way to scam and tax people to death.  Thanks to Al Gore and his lies people have bought this hook line and sinker.  Wake up people
"“Stop it, get some help.” -Michael Jordan"
"I don't know about the rest of you, but I could use some warmer temperatures right now."
You’ll know Climate Change is real when people like Obama and Zuck stop buying costal property

TRUMP 2024....TRUMP"
"Listen to us, we're the government and we have a report!!!"
"Warming? It's Cold right now, it's Winter. Wish Global Warming was Real. Northern States would feel like Florida by now."

😮 scam......😮😅😅
In power people make fake climate control poison water land sky and destroy farmland with arson forest fire never being 10 years ago
🤣😂
You can’t stop these changes.  Better/smarter to adapt.  It’s all a croc!
This is BS
"""Eyes open. No fear..."" S0"
More Propaganda
I'm still waiting for the ICE AGE TO HAPPEN that they were talking about
Then there's me fighting off frostbite in 25 degree weather in October in Indiana
Fear fear fear and fear and more fear. Thanks government and media.
"There is a tremendous opportunity for all you who think climate change is all a hoax. Insurance companies are bailing on certain types of coverage due to climate change. If you're so sure climate change isn't real or serious, you can start your own insurance company that doesn't change its coverage based on all this bogus climate nonsense. Put your money where your mouth is. Go on. I dare you."
All propaganda!
"Lets see , wreck economy with all green energy . Or temp rise and sea level rise . I pick later , less deaths"
The planet is tired of us mucking this place up. She’s trying to get rid of us. Even if we could fix the issue we won’t because humans are selfish beings.
"A fake report based on corrupt data published by incompetent fools, reported on by liars to further a totalitarian agenda."
Maybe Again ask Bill Gates what His take on climate change is ....
Fear fear fear!!!everyone be scared just like they want so you can be controlled!!!!
So we’ll be alright if we stop giving money to other countries 😂 and use it for our citizens
No one believes this crap anymore except for those who don’t do diligent research.
"Your climate propaganda has failed, give it up 😂😂😂😂"
I sleep.
"Excellent, does that include Math? Sorry but the IRA does almost nothing to reduce GHG emissions and $389 Billion will do nothing to change a $25 Trillion economy based on 80% Fossil Fuel Consumption. The numbers just don't add up. It is about 1.5% of what would be necessary, so really almost nothing. Especially when that $389 Billion is spread out over 10 Years (so 0.15% of what would be necessary) and the War Budget is $886 Billion every year, the Military is the largest institutional emitter of GHGs on Earth, so those are some weird numbers too . The correlation between global energy production and global GDP is overwhelmingly strong. A simple linear regression between energy production and GDP has a correlation coefficient of 0.997.You cannot run a $25 Trillion economy based on 80% Fossil Fuel use and expect 0.15% of GDP investment per year into Climate Stability to accomplish anything. Weirdest number of all? That the Biden administration somehow thinks these provisions will produce a 50% decrease in GHG emissions by 203O, that is comical in its stupidity."
"If you ever want to fool someone , or control them... Constantly give them data they can't verify..    solar and wind power is a novelty.. Coal and Nuclear energy is a must ..   Imagine pushing Expensive EV's with no power to charge them...  If you can't see through all this 
Bull Crap... Sell your Eternal Combustion Car and buy a BIKE...

Stop lying to the people.   You can’t control the climate. If it was the case India and china would be on the crap list.
"Oh No, Where's Al Dork (Gore)."
More BS scare tactics.
"The wetather meassurement was never reliable or consistent before 2000 so how can anyone says that it has been warmer the last 20 years than it was before 2000.
Its impossible to say because the wether collection was all over the place in terms of placement,time,height,places,wind and many many other factors that was not even close by todays meaurments."
It's a GRIFT!! The biggest grift there's ever been.
💵💵💵
So you're telling me my house in the high desert will get a beach front? Sweeet😎
Man didn’t cause global warming!
The sky is falling and only the DIVIDED STATES OF MURICA can fix it by bankrupting ourselves right now. Oh wait isn't what various countries around the world want? 😊 😮 😊 😮.
I have heard the lie of costal flooding since 1990 and 30 years later there has been no rise in sea level. Last I knew NO cities or homes have had to move from rising sea levels. Think of something new.
Climate change propaganda. Let me know when Obama sells his oceanfront property. FJB!
"What’s really going on is that no matter how much money you people make off of this or no matter how high your prestige in position in power is it will never be enough to buy you sufficient  air-conditioning for the climate change that’s coming upon you when you stand before the God of the universe and give a count for your deed, if this was such a worry they wouldn’t be stopping Elon musk from putting Audis thing that reduces the consumption of electricity by massive amount, But we see that is nixed  by politicians For the green deal that is greenback paper money"
"Love how wild fires are about climate change now, lol. Not about winds and dry regions."
Canada had many wildfires the world wants to keep playing games go head jesus will not save u
By 2016 the Maldives will be underwater unless you listen to private jet owners
Perfect time to utilize nuclear power!
Tell me what ppl will do with their electric cars in ten years when the batteries die
"I don't think this is about global warming, but bad drainage in these cities/states. Maybe they need to add more street vents or reconstruct the streets where water has nowhere to escape.

I don't believe in what scientist say because a lot of it is just nonsense. The most we will be able to predict is weather and even that's not always accurate. I believe global warming fixes itself through water recycle through rain."
"Imagine how many untold trillions of taxpayer dollars are being wasted on the ""climate change"" scam...🤑"
Complete BS! They are trying to manipulate you into poverty!!!! They want to control every aspect of your lives. To do this they have to claim the world is going to end if you don't follow their BS.
Gods judgement
Yeah it’s “really warm” where the arsonists were
🔋
Con-Artist.   They used to tar and feather these snake-oil salesmen years back....  sad.
Biggest buncha BS ever!! May God deal with all liars!!!
"If rising sea's were an issue, you would not be able to get loans to build in Florida or along most coastlines, nor would anyone provide insurance. I heard this morning that 'Global Warming' is causing the U.S. to be warmer than the rest of the planet. Is is global warming or U.S. warming? This is all so that they can tax us more to fix a problem that we cannot control. To think that humans can ruin a planet is just arrogance."
Stop lying to the American people
"Fear, fear, fear pumped in the viens of the masses brings the dollars to the corporate overlords. War amd genocide are fine but ohhhh the big bad weather going to get ya... 
Fear mongering a tactic of the ages."
How about we ban private jets.
"Climate change is a conspiracy, stop deforestation, the earth was created with water,formed with water, shaped with water, destroyed with water, next time with fire to punish the ungodly man, all of mankind, 2 Peter 3 v3,4,5...."
"Lies, propaganda, and agenda from the Talking Heads. For instance I have lived in AZ my entire life it is no hotter now.. The problem is that developers paid off the politicians and destroyed a once beautiful valley. It is now the Pit or if you like the Phoenix Metro Area and it can no longer cool down. Completely destroyed by full coverage of asphalt and concrete in addition to the heat generated by the Mob that now inhabits it. And let us not forget all of the stucco, chicken wire and tile boxes that pass as homes. It simply no longer cools. However the politicos did ensure the comfort of their ultra wealthy donors by taking the loot to develop the mountain sides where their donors would be safe and at least 15 degrees cooler. Every high spot is zoned to keep the 90-95% out. No more access to the special places many of us used to access. Private drives, gates, and entry not permitted for you. However for the help they have service roads below grade so that they cannot be seen by the Crime Bosses, oops I mean residents, They even house this Filth in what were once public Desert Parks. Drive up the 51 and you get to view a couple of 20 million dollar Crime Boss Hideouts where we used to hike."
What action are ya gonna take lol...
I'd take them much more seriously if these climate alarmists starred selling their properties on the coasts...
Wait until Gods wrath!
We're still on the warming end of the last ice age. What is so hard to understand about that?
More Fake Science from your Fake MEDIA!
Like I believe anything the government says after all this corruption currently in the White House.
"Do you not realize that people are calling B.S, there is no ""Climate Crisis"" There has been no increase in hurricanes, tornadoes, wild fires, heat waves, sea levels, water shortages, crops output, or migrants due to the climate! The climate alarmists want you to be fearful, that is how they operate!"
"But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up.  (2 Peter 3:10, NASB)"
People better worry about their souls versus this sinking ship.
The Earth is more likely to be flat than climate change itself LOL
"Pure propaganda. There is no increase in “climate disasters” related to CO2 levels. They simply want you to give up your lifestyle by transferring control to the UN. The head of the IPCC said,” it’s not about climate but wealth redistribution “."
+50°F in Northwest Minnesota this week. Not -50°F
Yall are worrying so much about climate change. You need to be concentrating on world relations. Because the most probable desolation to the world right now would certainly be caused by nuclear weapons. Your misplaced concern is amazing.
Propaganda
It's far too late to change it..
Climate change?? 😂😂🤣🤣
Population control
It seems letting the planet Die is much cheaper than WAR.......       🤑🤑🤑
"You wont be joking around saying ""climate change is fake"", ""its propaganda"" or its ""the media"" when your cold states start burning and your hot states start flooding and freezing in the winters, be my guest, people like that is why this planet wont last and change for the better"
There is NOT a fix for this NOT 1 that is like saying we can stop a asteroid the size of 1 city block from smashing into the earth.
Yes because the Republican party views climate change as witchcraft!!!
No😂
"There are many ways to verify the bs climate change claim considering data is widely available. I remember it use to be called global warming as well as a number of other things. 
I’ll know it’s for real when John Kerry sales his private jet, 15 houses, 20 luxury vehicles, and the powers that be stop meeting in Davos to secretly decide how much carbon tax they can implement on the peons of the world. The agenda is highly anti human."
"Photoelectric … “ …. (solar) panels and wind turbines are now less costly than ….” gas and coal.
Are they ? 
Without the government subsidies ?
What do people think about new nuclear generation ?   Will that help ?"
If used to be called global warming but people caught onto that scam.
Tell me bow electric cars will stop forest fires 😂😂😂ill wait
Climate has been changing since day one. Humans and farting cows can't change the climate
Not.
"This morning the forecast where i live was a high of 52 degrees. As of 12pm it was 55 and they were predicting 57.  Now they predicting 60 for a high. If they cant predict todays weather within 10 degrees today, how the hell do they expect me to believe they can predict 3 degrees rise in 50 years! Is  their electric bill $100 like mine? Jave they scraped their private jets and yahts? Does 1 congressman or scientist ride a bicycle to work? Why don't they be put in jail for getting it wrong? No accountability."
See that climate change banner that Google put up? Google is the king of propaganda.
The Biden administration is the most dangerous thing facing the USA
Don't look up.
Nothin new
It is starting to get cold here in Washington state.  My heating cost last year was through the roof and it has gone up every year for the last 30 years.  Not sure how well my Tesla will do in the snow.  When is Global warming going to kick in?
🐂💩
This is a dangerous road they are taking by saying this .Pending mass hysterra.
"I can't take the White House seriously on anything to do with the climate when you have multiple C-17 transport aircraft carrying numerous vehicles for the presidential motorcade, even for a domestic visit. Almost an equal number of large vehicles for Xi Jinping's motorcade as well. It's the average person that has to change their way of life, not the elite."
The governments careless spending is a much bigger threat. That and the government’s control of the weather. 🍻🤙🏻
"Stopping cheap energy production and chemical trail spraying from jets, warfare, and poorly maintained ""protected land"".  FOH"
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"No increase in hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, surface temperatures, or sea levels. 89% of all land masses over twenty-five acres have grown. The Antarctic has grown colder. According to the USCRN there has been no warming in the United States since it was established in 2005. There is no ""Climate Crisis"""
Cough cough…I’m dying here in North Carolina…it’s…it’s….climate change 😵 🤣🤣🤣
The climate scam
Just some more political BS to try and take the focus off of the wretched Bidet administration. A way to send taxpayers money to foreign governments to help who?  China will be importing solar panels for their benefit.
So is liberalism but no one is trying to stop it and it is much more destructive
Biden is killing me!  Climate change is a normal part of mother nature......
White house is threatening American lives much much more.
"Total BS.
Climate related and weather-related deaths are going down and they've been going down for decades.
Classic fearmongering"
Frank Capra filmed a documentary in 1958 warning about human caused global warming on the AT&T Science Hour. And you thought is was recent poltically motivated stuff. Lol. WRONG!
"Plants love CO2, and we need plants to live. I believe control of the world's energy resources are the underlining goal of this propaganda."
More bull!
"Im ratarded and glboal warming is scarey, i went through public edomcation system"
RUBBISH ABSOLUTE RUBBISH ALL MAN MADE TO SUPPORT THE NARRATIVE
"We trust the deep state msm,"
Comments from those who reside in states of denial are part of the problem & not contributing to solutions...until an event that makes it personal. Farmers & many of US aren't confused as we seek how we can work Together so the HueMan species can survive in our environment ☮💧🌎
Lies
"In a  inhabitable world ,will make us stronger 💪."
"Private jets should be outlawed, more rail, bus or trolley routes and bike lanes everywhere."
The cheaper for solar and wind  Will Not be cheaper if it takes off again it WILL skyrocket in price .They want there billions for it as well.
There are over 8 billion carbon footprints currently on the Earth. I think they want to take that down to half a billion. You are the carbon footprint that they want to reduce.
There must have been a lot of climate change in the dirty thirties. Wooo
"World Weather Attribution group says this is all about climate.  Duh. Every day it changes.  And the reason (so simple) people are struggling with the heat is because govt. has been spraying in front of the sun, playing God and then they stopped?  To make people suffer that would have naturally acclimated to the heat. But noooo, some suiciding scientists have to lie about the truth, who did this.  We know who did it and one day it will be payback time."
"so let me recapitulate : the climate change is responsible for climatic event that indicate climatic change ?

*HOLY MOLY!!!* 

i cried, still am. thank you that was a great laugh to start the day."
You should report on radio frequencies being used to alter weather patterns!
It’s a bit weird how all these international bodies say they want to use climate change as an excuse to seize control of industries and all of a sudden a bunch of dangerous climate change related events start happening
"No one cares. 

Push u n agenda for sustainable development somewhere else."
"Lol, ridiculous if people belive this propaganda Climate change is real and it's been happening for millions of years. Tax us and it will all go away 😆"
Millions will starve thanks to the current government and its policies . There goal to cut food production by 30 to 50 percent will come true. Cut fertilizer by 30 %  cut food production by up to 50 percent. Only some one that lives in Toronto thinks this will work. All supported by the liberal subsidized media .
"1) Why are you surprised at a drought in the American desert?
2) A drought that would only be seen once every four hundred years? How could that possibly be established?
3) The water has to be somewhere, is it all in the ocean? Is there anywhere on Earth that has higher than normal rainfall?
4) Soil samples from across the globe or specific areas?
5) Why am I left with more questions with answers when it comes to global reporting?"
One word desalination
Straight from Convid to climate change just like those conspiracy theorists predicted.
A conservative government cannot come fast enough.
"If we had a carbon tax, we might have avoided the five major ice ages millions of years ago."
"Why don't everyone look up "" harrp"", please discuss what you find with this money laundering scheme."
"In terms of the environment, it is necessary to re-evaluate Climate Change efforts. So far, the climate change movement has not prevented one square meter of land from eroding, saved the life of one person or animal, nor is responsible for the removal of one single piece of garbage from the roadside. This vastly expensive effort has yielded no results.

On the other hand, there are 200 years of environmental damage from industrialization which needs to be restored. Countless species have either been heavily damaged or destroyed. The climate change movement has taken so many resources away from these tangible problems and their feasible solutions. The concept of climate change has become so big, most other environmental problems are sadly neglected. So not just for the sake of the economy, the environment needs the government to downsize climate change spending and efforts. We need to concentrate on feasible solutions to tangible problems."
"TAKE YOUR CLIMATE CHANGE WOKE PSYCHO PROPAGANDA AND SHOVE IT GLOBAL NEWS. YOUR A PLAGUE TO SOCIETY. GOVERNMENT FED PROPAGANDA MACHINE.  We have people dying non stop of opiates you deadbeats, INFLATION. LIBERAL AGENDA IS A GREED FUELED CRIMINAL ACT"
"Yeah, right."
Remember those Rivers that were drying up in Germany and in Europe and stones started to be exposed. And on those stones were messages chiseled into them telling them that things are not going to be good if you see this Stone. That's cuz they had a drought back then too. This climate change stuff is just getting so boring. There are reports right now the sun is pulsating.
News flash. The climate on earth is always in a constant state of change and has been for millions of years.  Why do you think cold places on earth used to be tropical.  Man made climate change is a myth.
"You know what Canada should do, keep ruining our economy in order to bring the global temperature down .000000001 degrees over the next century 👍"
The frequent number of sun flare whips are responsible for it all.
Climate change  hahahaha    cry some more  about  muliputive nonsense     political agenda   get real ..
lmao
0:43- 0:50
Beware of the invisible boogeyman (especially when taxing you more is the cure).
Is it Sun 12/11yearly  solar
"The Dirty Thirties was also climate change and partially bad farm practices. The climate has been changing since the world was formed, we are moving closer to the Sun and people don’t want to address over population . There is No Way by 2030 or 2050 the biggest pollinators will have it under control. Canada is such a tiny percentage it really has No Bearing on Air pollination. I don’t think weather catastrophes are ever going to stop. Scientists aren’t anywhere near as smart as they think. That’s reality."
1.5 billion poor people will be murdered by the Fascist Liberal Globalists all in the name of climate !
no way its real?
"Climate Change = Supporting Opec/Russia/China... whilst our own North America leaders hand our country over to foreign entities, cough cough... (2019: Greta Thunberg (Who paid her to speak?), 2020: Covid, 2022: Ukraine, next: World War 3?)"
"People need to stop buying this green propaganda nonsense, it's just another way to control your life"
"I've been trying to find out the environmental impact of war. All the fires the weapons and destruction in conflict must have a big effect, is there a link between wars and weather and climate change?"
Solar cycle driven.
"These people (World Weather Attribution Group) wont even link to the study they are talking about. They say they looked at crops (agricultural drought) but claim ecological drought caused by climate change. I wonder what other factors they looked at before blaming climate change. I'd like to see the study but it's mysteriously hidden. This tells me it's a political group, not a scientific one."
Shut up
"The west wont do anything about climate catastrophe. 
Our governments are impotent when it comes too the needs of it's people.
The corporations own our governments and they get everything that want"
I think the grand canyon is like that Il
"Yes, climate change is connected to droughts, but no evidence exist that it was caused by man made co2."
GFY.
Weather manipulation is real. They've been doing here since the 40's. You can't tax your way to convenient weather. This is nothing but a grift.
Stop the lies and spreading this misinformation. Climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon. Quite using climate change to push political agendas.
So why is the shift to nuclear energy so slow?
Climate change linked to leftist hysteria in new study.
I wonder what early man blamed ?
"Well, then you should start screaming at China, since that country is, by far, the biggest contributor to climate change due to its massive, world-leading amount of CO2 emissions.

China, the #1 emitter of CO2 in the world.
China, the #1 emitter of CO2 in the world for the last 17 years in a row.
China, the country which emitted more CO2 by itself in 2021 than did the next seven nations combined.
China, the country which has emitted more total CO2 since 1990 than any other nation in the world.
China, the country whose per capita rate of CO2 emissions is already greater than that of Germany."
Blablahblah
Then why was it raining so much this year in British Columbia
The earth has had enough of our capitalist greed and has began ridding itself of humans while our stupid politicians keep trying to create more greed. How stupid we are as voters to continue to elect them.
Climate change??!!  Try weather wars.
Pure unadulterated gaslighting with a full measure of 🐂💩
Maybe if they stopped with all the chem trails it would help.
Let’s try controlling something smaller first like a river flooding or cleanup garage stopping the world from warming seams like a big task for humans right now in the winter time they are going to say it’s too cold or too much snow and when it melts it too muddy
"A new study says that climate change caused COVID, fentanyl addiction, human trafficking, liquor store robberies, shark attacks and an increase in finding  to study climate change."
US GOVERNMENT CONTROLS THE WEATHER THEY CREATED A DROUGHT
As if climate scientists haven't been warning this would happen for decades...
"Cloud seeding, weather bombs (Australia)  h.a.a.r.p & geo engineering is causing so called climate change. By the 2at bill gates wants to block out the sun because it's too hot lol"
Why are their Chinese police stations monitoring Chinese Canadians?
They sky is falling
"If the severity that is described by those who stand to profit the most from climate change infrastructure  was accurate, then Governments would be throttling back much more industry than they are.

Corporate greed conquers all."
Climate change linked to all horse sheet
"Liberal Party of Canada thinking, if we charge you more taxes we can change the weather.  Never mind that a slight variation in ocean currents, or a little variation in solar activity have more direct effect on climate than anything else.  And don't even think about asking questions about the cause of 1930s 'dust bowl.' The change is -real- because we say so."
The 1.5 billion masks in the ocean are a small price to pay to protect one from climate change.
"Have we crossed the point of no return in terms of damaging the planet? There is no such point. We need to trust that our thought, which is our greatest quality, can change nature. We only need to understand the direction to which we should aim our thoughts. What should we think about? What condition or state should we aspire to and ask for?
In order to save our planet, we should think about positive human connections. That is, how can we, in our connections, keep nature safe? How can we all together protect our world? If we truly wish to better our planet, then we should see people holding a concern for how to positively connect everywhere that we look.
It has nothing to do with recycling or other activities that we commonly associate with as being sustainable. If we come closer to and consider each other, that we will reach an entirely organic, perfectly connected and round state, then the negative forces will disappear from the world.
We need to understand that if we start thinking better about each other, then the planet will recover from all harm, because our thoughts are the strongest force in nature. Likewise, our negative thoughts about each other are entirely to blame for damaging the planet. That is why the more we recycle and invest in energies and activities that we commonly think of as being sustainable, the worse our planet becomes. Nothing will work to benefit us until we reach a state where our attitude changes toward each other for the better to protect and improve our planet."
"MY GAWD! TU STULTUS ES!
Newsflash... the climate has always been changing and will continue to. It was changing eons before humans arrived and will change for eons after we are gone."
Glad Europe is being cut off from gas and oil that should be abit less pollution
Trudeau has the largest carbon footprint of any Canadian.  We should start by eliminating him!
"Perhaps this study may not convey all the facts. Likely,  it’s possible but, no one is saying it is directly caused by humans. I can use the same words to skirt the issue as well."
Global news needs to talk about Ecosia they are a search engine that plants trees
Of course it is... 🥱. Billionaires.... Fighting climate change one container ship from China at a time.. one bomb at a Time. One blockbuster film at a time.
Climate has been changing for millions of years before you were here.
"Droughts linked to 
gee 0 engineering!"
Stop manipulating the weather and it will correct itself
Would a story saying anything else ever be published?
"Fakenews drought isn't caused by climate. Drought is caused by improper water management on the ground. What goes up must come down, water evaporates and it comes down as rain. The reason why those droughts happen is because once the water comes down it has no place to be stored and it just flows away into the sea. Or it gets absorbed by farming heavy water usage crops. Or it gets sequestered by some dam upstream."
"If they want one steady climate they’ve got a lot of weather manipulation to harness. They can’t cry at every change. Next, when it rains, they’ll say it’s flooding. Mental"
"Better tax the average consumer, and throw more money at “climate change… That’ll make it all go away 😊👌"
Plastic money made via carbon tax will save us.
Triple the carbon tax. That will sure fix it
The U.N. never gives up on over hyping natural activities and somehow pinning them on man. No honest science from these charlatans. Maybe Obuma should build another mansion on a threatened coastline that he claimed would be under water by now.
Polar icecaps aren’t constant. They come and go. I wouldn’t call it anarchy.
Are we gonna die? Is there a 2012 tsunami coming?
Better tax it so it stops 😂😂😂
"OK guys grade 6 science.. put ice in a glass, fill with water as full as you can make it, ice will be siting higher then the glass. what happens when the ice melts?  nothing the water in the glass will stay at the same level  without overflowing.  ice that is floating on the surface has already displaced the water melting it will do nothing. all the ice can melt break off nothing will happen to sea level."
In the 70-80's we were going to be in an ice age. Late 90's we were going to drown by 2012. Still waiting on the climate scams to happen.
Don't mention the massive ice breakers canada Russia use breaking ice that naturally wouldn't be broke for shipping its always climate change effects of ppl but never that special word natural variation our contributions to climate are so small that it can't be measured above or below natural variation... and what the radical climate alarmists want to do would obviously be more devastating to mankind than what ever the climate throws at us that we can adapt to like wa always do .😊
Floating chunk of ice....who...the ....fk.....cares.
Regardless of his accent I’m glad he talked slow & clear where I could understand him.😊
Humans are not in control…the planet has always gone through climate cycles since time began &  will carry on a usual no matter what humans do…
I dont understand why I'm supposed to try to stop the ice from melting.  If the caps melt and the Earth readjusts its temperature.   What am i trying to prevent?  Do I need more or less clothes I don't get it.
Can't This Cause A Great Flood Depending Where It Heads To?
I`m sure for all the other animals on this planet we can't destroy ourselves quick enough.
"Wait, so all my carbon taxes hasn’t helped this poor iceberg?"
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
"What a waste of time ..... This is great!!!!!

This means more clean water for the world in the water pool .... Or maybe more water for Nestle"
"We should pay more taxes,that’ll help"
"I don’t agree with the old man at the end. Has nothing to do with fossil files or at least very little. It’s all to do with magnetic pole reversal, effects everything down. Airflow currents and magma under the earths crusts. Carbon tax is the biggest fraud they have ever put into us working class citizens in earth"
Well time to prepare for the floods
Does anyone else remember Pablo the Penguin?
I don't  trust  computer  models  because  data is always  being  manipulated for political  reasons.
"All that ice melted and there's no major flooding caused by it, the ice is sitting in the ocean already displacing most of its volume, they're crying wolf when there's no wolf."
And how did you get to Antarctica. Well we flew there on an airplane that use fossil fuel. Next video.
"Clownshoe science still has a clown in the shoes. The shoes dont make the scientist. The scientist makes the shoes.
And all the makeup and glitter wont change the fact that the sun is in control, not mankind. You can honk the horn all you like. And ignore all of the realities of the full field of science that say its the sun, its time for a 6k and 12k cycle repeat, thats fine. The reality is, none of the modern world will last more than fifty years from now."
"Oh, no, more scary nonsense from another mystical ""expert."" I guess we'd better give more money to the politicians so they can protect us from the boogeyman."
So an iceberg moved after being hung up for 30 years and now the world's going to end 😅😅😅😅 that's what icebergs do they move
This can't be good for the prospect of global warming... surely we are capable of stopping this happening?
"Oh my an iceberg moving, oh no climate crisis   end of world, you people need a real job"
"No arctic ice by 2012
No more polar bears

Unless you pay a higher ""price on pollution"", of course.

Just spare us the propaganda."
More and more people are waking up to the bold-faced lies and climate change propagandists.
"Here comes the climate change, fear mongers 😆"
Send 1000 Drones with 4k cameras south. Free Antarctica!
Funny how it’s only the Liberal mentality crying about climate change. Education is key to understanding our changing world for 5 billion years
"The usual climate change denial on the comments below, and the same stereotypical arguments:
Climate change always happened... yes it has, but humans have evolved in a largely 'stable' climate. 
The Poles are not melting... yes, they are, this has been proven and has been happening for decades. 
It doesn't matter if the Poles melt... yes it does, the sea will rise ""100 metres,"" billions of people could be displaced, and millions more die!

*These people 'shoot their mouths off' but unfortunately the last thing they do is ""think"" and do their 'research?'"
"the sky is falling, give the government more money."
"Hey, Great Britain 🇬🇧  I'm very worried about it going into the peninsula, which is a feeding and breeding ground for the seals and penguins.🐧 If it slams into the peninsula, I only shudder to think what will happen to the seals and penguins. Im sure they are safer there from predators...These animals are likened to the dogs and cats- of the sea...Please watch over these fragile creatures !!!"
Better raise taxes so the government can pretend to control the environment!
Yes but Jordan Peterson says it doesn’t exist. 🤔 You are not more qualified than a PhD In psychology.
So many smooth brained climate alarmists in here wow.
AAWWEEESOMEE!!! Now make multiple climate articles about it and slam it with ads and anti-adblockers
Lies !!! You human broken and touch the ices!!!
"Blah blah blah its all fear mongering to try to push climate protests, we bren hearing news about this for years nothing new is happening"
To stop the iceberg melting we have to make sure we got the booster shots up to date. .
Blah blah blah fear fear fear control control control
If Antarctica Thaws we will be fending off Nephilim who we stole their Fallen Angel Technology
When will mankind realize we can’t stop nature
Why aren't those living in Antarctica paying a carbon tax?
Planet is fine they just want a reason to tax for for existence.
"This is your brain🧠, this is your brain believing in  climate change🍳. Don't believe in climate change."
😂
"It could ...... It might not .
It should ..... It shouldn't.
Sounds like my ex girlfriend when she cant make up her mind what to wear"
You can thank oil & gas companies for all this melted ice..
Only thing that will fix this issue and push the ice bergs back is more higher tax’s. if we starve the blue collar more it will help climate change.

I wonder if the axis has shifted over the last 50 years.
"When icebergs melt, the sea level lowers. :)"
Antarctica belongs to the Penguins.
Mother nature's defense against warming ocean temperatures
"OK.  Guy's got a teleprompter on his little ship and video of penguins moving around,  but where is the video of the Portugal size ice cube?"
Icebergs are 70% below the surface and therefore have very little impact on sea levels.
"Of course, all the busy governments doing all their nafariouse supply chain wars has caused issues that they blame the tax payer for calling it climate change. Stop lying to why?"
Well if it do happen is because god allowed it..
Lies and propaganda to push FAKE climate change.
"Antarctica iceberg regenerating , warning of worldwide climate change itself , melting of iceberg water level will may go higher"
"I find it ""rich,"" that all these corporations are jumping on board this climate change band wagon meanwhile they engineer obsolescence into their products for us to consume while them along with our governments continue saying ""we use too much."" Big money buys big government."
I think there's more than climate change happening in Antarctica.
Climate change fear factor
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
"If the ice melts expect penguins polar bears  and seals to move into tent cities near you.,,,"
"Indeed. It doesn’t stay in Antarctica, consequences can be seen at first sight."
what other things can we speculate and guess at...hmmm what will butterflys do next decade?   will deer populations go up or down?    will Dachshunds win at Westminster this year?
Seafarers beware in the southern ocean.
"Well the Ice hasn’t always been there so scientists should assume we can live without it there again.
Don’t understand why scientists never talk about human overpopulation just human pollution , which is the symptom not the cause.
Nature continually tries to control overpopulation. Reality!"
"Matthew 24:7 For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another.

So i remember them talking about this when i worked for greenpeace in the summer when i was in high school.
Another politician that thinks people should believe his lies.
All these shots are clearly not of the iceburg but of rock on solid land. The scare tactics are pathetic
"It is almost like we have dig a giant hole into the Earth and drain the Ocean into the ground where it can meet hot Lava and somehow vaporise into the atmosphere raising humidity into untold levels.
 In other words, this world, we are all fk'd and cant' think of a single thing to about it.
Maybe, moving away from any coast line and making your way to Canada and support the polar Bears and their little, starving,  children."
"Warning ,what can we do about it, it’s a natural process"
so can these guys explain when north america was under 10 meters of ice during ice age quest alot of suvs back then
"Thanks China 🇨🇳 for
- building more and more *coal-fired power plants,* and 
- burning more and more *fossil fuel.*"
"Antarctica, perhaps.  I think it was last year it had record average low temps.  Its highly speculative to assume one year alone will NOT dictate the future in either direction.  Nonetheless, historically climate changes over time regardless and oscillates hot then cold then hot again."
Clearly more carbon tax can remedy this
Well I am safe in Alberta!  🤣
Global warming anybody? 😅😊😂
The un? Lmfao 😂 the un says...😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A23 where going trip ?
Ice either grows or leaves. It doesnt stay the same. If you still buy it. Youre an NPC.
You gotta love penquins
Ahhhh! We're all going to die!!!
Well I came to see the iceberg but he  looks good too
The Climate Narrative keeps shifting
F ing lying.
THE WEF ONCE AGAIN… WE SLAVES SOON
"Americans (& so, probably everyone) are still installing gas stoves! When we need to eliminate them! And remodeling houses is destroying the Earth: new carpets, floors, walls, everything! And none of them should have ever been built!
Because we should have built on TOWER CITIES connected to maglev TRAINS because none of these climate change horrors would be happening!

"This year, many countries are badly hit by climate disasters, no matter rich or poor nations.  Climate change is the most serious world issues, all the world must play active roles to stop CO2 emissions."
😂. Can't wait for Mad Max.
"Carbon dioxide is one of the major GHGs and a driver in the domain of climate change. In the drive to mitigate and adapt with the issue of climate change, carbon trading has become a vital policy instrument in majority of the countries in the World. It is also a pivotal element of the UNFCCC’s approach to tackle climate change. National or regional carbon trading schemes are now operational in many counties through a well-defined structural policy, specific for the country. Yet the trading is still in a volatile stage. Many schools think that this concept is not very realistic to combat climate change, while others consider this a strict regulation to put cap/limit on the emitters. Unfortunately, the subject is characterised by jargon, abstract concepts, mathematical formulae, and technical detail, making it hard for most people to understand its implications and evaluate its merits and demerits. This paper is a first order analysis to unravel some of this complexity by imparting thrust on three basic components – cap and trade, carbon offsets and carbon trading – which underpin the trade in carbon quotas. The case study of the highly urbanized city of Kolkata and Indian Sundarban mangrove ecosystem has been discussed in details with CO2 – e of dominant trees to analyse the probable credit that can be received from the producer communities of these two sites that are significantly different in terms of anthropogenic footprints and ecological features.

There is no saving climate change because this world still allows evil wicked people to still do evil God is judging evil wicked people. The world leaders are not taken God waring to stop the evilness and wickedness of the earth. But the leaders are not listening. Also this is evil wicked leaders fault.
"You don’t have to convince scientists, you might need to convince wealthy people who have a strangle hold on the means of production and the hoarding of capital who would sacrifice all of us to feed their greed and hold on power.  When will common Americans wake up and slap down these goons !?"
Hi. Why after 30+ years of climate change predictions they are at 0.0000% right. Absolute 0.0%.
Its man made alright. Also known as. Geoengineering and weather modification. The elites are in the midst of the great culling. Behold we are the carbon they want to eliminate. Stop listening to these wicked people and research for yourself.
China also has 1.4 billion people. The US has 333 million. So per capita the US is by far the biggest emitter of CO2.
🤣🤣🤣🤣what a farce
"Imagine the low IQ required to believe climate change is anything other than another phrase for seasons. Seasons naturally occur every year, are healthy and required for the earth and its inhabitants to live. The world's temperature has not risen, the world is not about to end, nor should we be concerned. Live in Reality."

  Remember hole in OZONE was cooling planet and removed arousals (hairspray) etc ... hehehe they where wrong so same people started this new approach looking at temps last 150yrs.  Look at graph last 150million yrs. but that don't match so it's 150 yrs.  A JOKE !"

"Brr.  climate change just nuclear lies
https://jtvideos.blogspot.com/2023/11/climate-change-just-nuclear-lies.html
	After the Chernobyl incident in 1986, nuclear power was desperate to justify its continued existence.  So he paid its academic stooges to concocted manmade global warming."
"Time for facts.... there has been no increase in hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, heatwaves, or wildfires. There has been no rapid rise in sea levels, if any at all? There has only been a surface temperature increase globally because of NOAA and NASA artificially inflating numbers, to fit IPPC models, which have never been correct. There is no proof that there is a ""Climate Crisis"""
"You know they keep talking about Global Warming effects escalating and causing all these back to back ""1000"" year floods and Disasters. I wonder why when they talk about the cause of it, no one ever brings up the cloud seeding that's been going on. Isn't it possible that messing with the clouds is messing up the whole system and causing some of these effects that are being blamed on Global Warming. The way things seem to be escalating at a much faster rate than expected, shouldn't that possibility at least be part of the discussion? They call themselves trying to solve a problem by tampering with the Clouds and the weather with weather modifying technologies but what if it's making the problem worse and speeding things up."
scientists sounded the alarm on climate change in the early 1980's...
""" If buildings had dampened floors there wouldnt be any forest fires."" !!!!!!! The only thing you can say about Trump and Climate is that he has NET ZERO brain cells."
man cannot control climate change.
"There have been floods the same for 10000s of years ,the Democrats just want their fake Global warming money"
"According to geological records for the past 600 million years, global temperatures range from 8°c to 22°c, now 13°c. There is no relationship between CO2 and temperature. Anyway, CO2 dropped from 7000ppm to current 350ppm. Why the urgency to freeze millions of people to death? I may be wrong; none of the countless end-of-the-world predictions has ever come true. Climate modelling is junk science paid for by profiteering groups."
Yet these fools have no idea what they speak of.  Any model is made up numbers and they can make the outcome as they desire.  It’s all a lie.

"Texas is hot, but I remember when it was colder in October"
We need to ban cooking at home.  If you burn food it creates carbon.
"FYI, the climate is being changed by intentional geoengineering, NOT normal human activity and cow farts.

How about going back to 1 billion people?

"OMG...the end is near.  This BS has been going on for 35 years, ever since ""The Godfather of Climate Change"" James Hansen testified in 1988 in a room where the senators supporting his testimony intentionally defeated the air conditioning so as to make the room hotter.  So many failed predictions have been made since then; I cannot understand how anyone who's actually been exposed to ALL THE INFORMATION could possibly believe that CO2 is dangerous and will bring an end to this planet.  The biggest scam of our day."

Change your life.

If they can't make money off of it they won't make it. In the end it will always only be up to you.

We do not have a climate change issue to fight. That's just scapegoating for the ego intensified humans.

This climate change is yet again simply one more symptom..... that would not exist if our species were not on this planet.....that we are trying to pass the buck on.

The world...'earth'.... doesn't have plastic problems. Doesn't have food insecurity problems. Doesn't have coral reef problems. Doesn't lack funding for these problems?? Doesn't have Forest problems. Doesn't have fish problems...... Just human egos. Just a greed and profit human society that is the backbone foundation that creates these explosive symptoms. We humans are doing this. Not the Dolphins. Not the elephants. Not the hummingbirds. The ONLY fix is to change humanity. The detestable society it created. With its gods and shopping and holidays and sports....yadda, yadda, yadda......all fake ego crap. There is an us-against-them mentality around every corner to keep us on our toes and competitive. Yes, that is your every waking moment. That is how much time you spend destroying the planet with your meaningless garbage ego crap....... Every...waking...moment.

Quit trying to fix the climate (and making it worse) when the only problem that needs fixing is the human race.

And this unfortunately is not fixable. There won't be a climate 'diet pill' made for you here.
 People will fight change with everything inside of them. They will go to war over change.

So don't talk about changing anything, unless you want to feel good about yourself and uselessly vote for a government (whatever??) that's going to fix the world for you like a diet pill you fat gluttonous consumer pig. 

This is the real fight.... The enemy of climate change is staring you in the mirror. The battleground is your lifestyle.

Don't look up."

"If Climate Change was real then Centralia, PA would be a priority to put out a fire that’s been burning for over 60 years.  I thought America exterminated the millions of buffalo 🦬 in the last 200 years that must have eliminated a lot of CO2 emissions now didn’t it?  After all you’re saying killing 200,000 cows will make a tremendous difference?  So why didn’t the Buffalo extermination make a difference?"
"Don't forget that much of the CO2 that China has emitted - is for making the things that the rest of us keep buying (and often throwing away a few weeks later when they break). 
Now that India is doing its utmost to take the title of 'manufacturer to the world' from China, its CO2 emissions are going to rise exponentially, and they have already demonstrated that they have as much concern about climate change (and slavery) as the Chinese ever had. 

The only people who can really make the change - are us, here in the West. Stop buying endless stupid things you don't need. 

To be honest, I think it's over. 
Not enough people are listening to the scientists, not enough people either believe in climate change or are working hard enough to change their lifestyles. 
Why should I cut back any more, when my neighbour doesn't care and makes no effort at all? Climate change will wipe out their families - so let it. Let the world start again from toxic algal blooms - if that's what it takes."

And 5 to 10 degrees warmer during the Jurassic period? Carbon Dioxide was about 4 times greater then. What makes it so bad now? Is it ""bad carbon"" now and was it ""good carbon"" back then? And why is the map covered in blacks and reds? Is this really needed to show temperature differences or is it just to try to scare people? Sorry for all the questions good people but I really think we are being hogwashed here."
This is all nonsense.  Scientists won't get billions of dollars from the government for research if they dont come up with some kind of impeding disaster.  When i was a kid it was acid rain was going to destroy the planet.  Now with the internet you have access to everything as it happens and you dont have to read the newspaper.

You know what could help instead of reporting and complaing how about you do somthing stop flying your expensive jets and cars oh no just blame the common folk
It's the end of the world as we know it (I feel fine)
Yes the temperatures were a lie. They took ground temperatures  not the standard air temp Wich is taken at two meters ofg the ground where it's much cooler and used those to instill fear. It's an agenda.
"The Arctic ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot, according to a report to the Commerce Department yesterday from Consulafft, at Bergen, Norway.

Reports from fishermen, seal hunters and explorers all point to a radical change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard-of temperatures in the Arctic zone. Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes. Soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters showed the gulf stream still very warm. Great masses of ice have been replaced by moraines of earth and stones, the report continued, while at many points well known glaciers have entirely disappeared.

Very few seals and no white fish are found in the eastern Arctic, while vast shoals of herring and smelts which have never before ventured so far north, are being encountered in the old seal fishing grounds.

I apologize, I neglected to mention that this report was from November 2, 1922. As reported by the AP and published in The Washington Post — 88 years ago!"

No longer can ppl kind deny that summer is hot
"The only problem is they are lying about the real temperature.  Temperature has ALWAYS been measured by air temperature, which is the temperature as measured at 2 meters or 6 feet above the earth's surface.  The 48 degree celsius (C) or 126 degrees fahrenheit (F) being reported is the ground temperature.  The MSM knows this fact, but decided to report it falsely anyway.  A quick and easy way to convert C to F, is too multiply 48 (C) by 2 and add 30.  48 X 2 = 96 + 30 = 126 (F).  While not exact, it is close."

No different than the heat waves from the mid 1930's and 1970's. I would say since the industrial revolution our planet has adapted to us and our needs. In all honesty I think the planet is getting back to normal as it was during the Jurassic Era. Meaning it has taken 66 million years for the Earth to return to normal after an extinction level asteroid strike.

Welcome to summer
You get what you seed.
Hmmm there is a publication out the by the u.s. army something called weather as a weapon and it explains how they control the weather!  This is 4th dimensional warefare!  Wake up people!
Uh your city is named Phoenix and its in the desert why is it so hot😂😂😂

"I'm looking at Total Precipitable Water in Phoenix throughout July, and it shows that Pluvicopia could be converting their heat into rain and cooling. The process could fill Lake Mead with a few systems. At the same time, those systems would provide millions of additional acres of new arable land throughout Arizona and Southern CA. The book Pluvicopia identifies the best prototype for complete development to suffice for all of Southern CA with one system converting the heat and humidity of the Salton Sea into energy and water."

Droughts have always been a problem. No place where they have studied the geological past has shown any difference in now and that past.

'the new reality' of climate change is that the water companies will have to stop bottling and selling off our water in shops. ( we know it's not really spring water )
"The weather has never and will never be stable, its been in a state of flux for ever. This point in time it is hot,  in 1000 year it could be ice age again. Why people judge these thing in such short time frames is stupid."
"Total BS , a natural cycle of unpredictable that's life,"
Due to the fact that drought is a result of climate change we must all take drastic actions !  We must start to hand wash our clothes and dry them outside on clothes lines !  We must start carpooling to work and possibly walking !  Women must stop using toxic chemicals to remove their makeup to stop the contamination of landfills !  Some of the most toxic chemicals on earth are in female beauty products !

"Drought is the 'reality' of poor/lack of investment, for decades, by utility companies in infrastructure and storage. This happens every summer to a varying degree, yet nothing is done to the infrastructure to mitigate this. Don't blame poor management on the climate. The great engineers of the past would be seeing this as an opportunity to improve, not apportion blame of a natural phenomenon. Countries that live with these conditions 100% of the year don't seem to have problems like we do when we have these conditions for a couple of months."
Sky News doing their best to push the Green panic. 🔴
Since privatisation they have spent little on reservoirs. Also most of the water that falls on hard surfaces i.e. roads and pavements is flushed straight to the sea i.e. we need more SUDS in our recharge aquifers.
Its called a solar minimum. The sun is causing this extreme weather events. It got up to 140 degrees in summer in the 1600s. This is nothing. The sun has more in store for us. Check out the maunder solar minimum for what we can expect for the next 18 years.

If the water situation is bad now it will be a million times worse during the tribulation period especially the 2nd half when fresh water will be more valuable than gold."
I'm sure we had a similar summer in 1976 and 2006 and we're still here.. nuts 🤪
Imagine living in an historically drought prone region. It won't be good for those poor people.
"This is all the world governments and the companies fault for allowing to continued with buring fossil fuels which has cause this intence heatwaves🥵 in the first place. I like Summer as the sun shining the blue sky but this is really getting out of hands as the heatwaves cause a lot of wildfires and drough which result other Countries field and crops to dry up as well as banned hosepipes to save water.

If anyone had taken this climate change and the enviroment seriously as well as doing more about this then there wouldn't have been so much problems this year in the first place."
Surprise!!!!
Droughts and floods have been a natural phenomena for thousands of years.
Project fear!! Average rainfall has not changed since records began 250 years ago.
So why was it just as hot in 76 ... p off with this bollox
"It rained a few weeks ago,, CraZy weather at 32 degrees 😎😎. So where is the climate change taking all this evaporated water?"
"mother nature is a life force to be stepped on, as reversing climate change is too late and these countries will have to get used to it as it will reoccur every year what is scary is heat temps will get worse might not just heat thunderstorms too"
"This is what they told us:

""Using a range of methods including model simulations developed by the Met Office Hadley Centre in the U.K., the researchers found that, while average rainfall is expected to increase at a median average rate of 2.32% per degree Celsius of warming worldwide, precipitation variability will increase between 4.85 and 5.70% per degree of warming across all regions.""

I wish they would make their minds up!"

As water supply companies are turning to phreatic tables and rivers, incorporation of SuDS systems into new housing developments is halting the surplus supply of water to our rivers and watercourses via storm drain systems, an ironic “environmental help” has resulted in exacerbation to the drought, society halts information critical of environmentally friendly technologies.

We must stand up for our personal rights for running water through a hose. Do not comply to their neglect and entirely their faults, it’s a basic violation of human rights…,

Climate change ate my homework and stole my last rolo.
"Looking back at recordable data,  CO2 levels have been much higher and life thrived.  If humans only create a small percentage of the CO2 and the planet naturally produces the rest,  how can that be changed.  Yet the Governments are soooo concerned,  they won't stop the deep sea trawling which is killing off the sea bed.  The very oceans that hold the CO2. If the sea beds are dead,  lots of CO2 will be released.  So none of what they are saying or doing makes sense."

How much water do we loose through leakage 
How much extra do the water companies invest each year on improvement

"richard betts should provide untampered, empirical and direct evidence for his man made climate change claims"
"This happened 500 years ago and in 1935 and 1976.Might have a drought now but it’s a flash in the pan it’s not permanent as history shows. Also the uk population has grown by 20 million in the last 40 years and no extra reservoirs have been built.What happened to the polar ice caps melting and the sea and river levels rising which they’ve been banging on about for the last 23 years,now they are saying the opposite to that 😂"
"Weather patterns have been constantly changing since the earth was formed. It will continue to do so until the sun swallows it. The Sahara Desert was once a green, lush savannah until 8,000 years ago, when weather patterns changed. The UK has undergone four ice ages in the past 2 million years. Animals only found in Africa today, once roamed the UK. We can only have a marginal effect on changing weather. The earth both builds and destroys, it is a dynamic process that knows no end. We are seeing it in California and the American Southwest. Weather patterns now returning to those that prevailed ages ago. And they created the deserts and arid lands of California and the southwestern states. Iceland has experienced volcanic eruptions in the past 20 years. Who is to say that the ""Ring of Fire"" doesn't extent northwestward under the Greenland and Artic Icecaps and is causing the ice to melt?"
"Stop the chicken little crap.
Now is the time to build a lock.
its not the first time there was a drought and it has nothing to do with the climate change frauds people are pushing to collect money for nothing.
Probably holes in the atmosphere from sending ships into space lingering over the area.
it will probably get as bad as the drought in Somalia a while back."
Its our ineptitude at storing water that has caused this drought.
"Yep, keep piling on the bullshit, this is seasonal weather activity and has nothing to do with climate change. 
Check the weather records! Nothing unusual about this / remember the potato failures of the 1970s - no change there then."
Less nuclear energy and more russian gas = results
Drought 'the new reality' of climate change. BS The current drought is just an aspect of the variability of weather. Stand by for floods.
"The biggest problem is UNPREDICTABLE weather, not just that the weather is getting worse."
We may be forced to resort to nuclear desalination.   Maybe using helium cooled reactors if water is scarce.
We used to call it a hot summer
……more climate horseshit from SLY NEWS…🥱
In other news…what a lovely summer we have!😁😊 enjoy people!
"What's happening then?....oh, climate change, that the 'experts & rich people' are blaming on us. Us, being the 0.0014 of 1% affect on the climate's change...yep, that definitely makes it our fault then. Nothing to do with huge corporations/industrial installations or more importantly, the natural causes such as volcanic eruptions, the world's oceans releasing huge amounts of CO2, (which in turn, helps plant life flourish). How the variations in the position of the sun & the planets including earth mean the earth warms & cools over then of thousands of years. But obviously its still our fault that we are having an extended summer. It is, however, very handy, now that the 'virus' is less prevalent & when they want to play the climate change card, that amazingly, we in the UK & Europe, are experiencing something that happens now & again, but we must believe that is all because of man-made climate change. Thankfully, there are those of us that see the world & beyond in a very different way than many. From that, we are able to protect ourselves. Those who choose to ignore what's happening in front of their very eyes must live with the consequences of their ignorance."
"It's obviously Mother Nature saying there's too many people on her planet, using too much of her resources."
Yet they tell us sea levels will reach point of massive floods.🤡

	The importance of droughts, so plant's sucking carbon dioxide within 5 minutes.  Converting a day is carbon dioxide into active plant biomass within 5 minutes.
	And 99.9996% are the days carbon dioxide is from animal respiration.  So man carriers carbon emissions are lost in the environmental noise of measurement!  We really do not matter to nature."
"It's a reality because instead of adapting to the planet as it changes we're arguing about reversing something that may not be able or should not be reversed

Honest question- will the 7 months of rain during the year not refill it?
"So 1921, 1975 1976 1980s were droughts caused by global warming 🤣"
Maybe they should tell us what effect all spraying of the skies is having on the weather.
Climate change eh? We used to call it summer.
"ofcourse it is look at the climate, don't look at the governments or consider blaming them cos there would be riots"
I wonder if this guy has his fingers crossed hoping its not going to be a wet summer next year.
A love mainstream agendas . Just wall to wall clap trap 👏
"Bull sh.t the new news, from sky news."
"Ever noticed how climate change religionists like to talk about climate not weather, until they decide that a tiny variation (weather) is climate change thus talk about climate? Insane, the lot of them."
Now I'm far from an expert. What happens when all of the Ice and water melt and weight loss in the Arctic and the Antarctic? Does the Earth start to wobble? Do the magnetic poles switch? Would that affect earthquakes? Would that affect the spin of the Earth? Would that change the seasons or tilt towards the sun? Would it become very rainy or dry on land? Just asking.
Ww3 was enough for me to watch looney left info. Lol climate change is supposed to be when theres nothing going on in the news.

"Yeah we were suppose to be underwater by now listening to these ""experts"". They know the climate in 100 years but can't tell this week's forecast accurately? Mars also got 1 degree hotter too, without an atmosphere... NASA experts didn't think climate change was a thing until Obama defunded them. 🤔. If these politicians really cared about the environment like they say they do, they wouldnt buy beach front property that erodes away the sea wall. I'm all for a cleaner environment but I want the facts. Like the fact that you would need to own a Tesla for 23 years before it even starts to reduce the carbon footprint it leaves just by producing the massive battery for it. While most people cant even afford a Tesla. Nor do most people keep a car for that long."

"Who is God in Islam ?
Muslims believe that God has no partners or associates who share in His divinity or authority and that God is transcendent, unlike His creations, and thus has no physical form. Nor is God believed to exist in (or be represented by) any material object. A number of divine attributes or “names,” which serve to describe God, are found in the Qur’an. Some commonly known attributes include the Most Merciful, the Most Forgiving, the Most High, the Unique, and the Everlasting, among others."

"Climate changes every year and has done so since the dinosaurs. Just another one of the hoaxes from those who have no clue.

"The Earths climate has always been changing due to changes in the world

Did cavemen cause the ice age? 

Did people dry up the bodies of water that eventually became the Grand Canyon?

Did dinosaurs cause the breakup of Pangea.

Human beings throughout time have adapted to worse conditions than this with way less technology and information.

Like it or not the earth has always been changing. There is no need to scare people with pointless predictions. Let’s just do the best we can with what we have."

"Medicine According to Cherokee Legend 
The Old Ones say that at one time all of Creation spoke the same language. The plants could communicate with the finned ones, the four-leggeds could speak with the trees, the stones could talk with the wind, and even the most dependent, most pitiful part of creation, the two-leggeds, or as we have come to call ourselves, the humans, could also speak with the other parts of creation. All existed in harmony. The plants, the animals, and the elements of the Four Directions (all existence) all knew that if the two-leggeds were to survive, they would need help.
The animals gave of themselves, willingly sacrificing, so that the humans could have food. They knew that their skins were much better suited to survival than that of the humans, so they allowed their skins to be taken and used for clothing and shelter. The Finned ones, The Fliers, and the Crawlers also allowed themselves to be used by the humans, to insure their survival.
The Plant people, the Standing people (trees), and the Stone People (rocks) freely gave of themselves so that the humans had what they needed for food, clothing, and shelter. An agreement was forged that the two-leggeds would ask permission for these gifts, give thanks for the sacrifice, and take no more than they needed. And so, it was good.
But then, the two-leggeds started growing in numbers, and began to feel themselves more important than the rest of creation. They began to believe that the Web of Life revolved around them, ignoring the fact that they were just one small part of the Circle. The two-leggeds began to kill without asking for permission. They began to take more than they needed. They ceased to give thanks. All parts of the agreement were broken.
The great Animal Councils banded together to determine what they should do to right these wrongs. They needed to protect themselves from destruction and eradication. And so, it was decreed by the council, if one of their clan was killed by the two-leggeds and thanks was not given for the sacrifice, the Chief Animal Spirit would afflict the disrespectful killer with a devastating disease.
The plants were distressed and said to the animals, “They wrong us, too. They dig us up, trample us, burn us out, and don’t even listen when we try to tell them what we can do to help them. Yet, we feel compassion for the two-leggeds. Man struggles to realize his place in the web of creation and he cannot learn if he is wiped out by disease. Man needs our help, so for every disease you animals bring to them, we, the Plant People will give them a cure. All the two-leggeds have to do is ‘ listen’ when we talk to them.”

The human primate is undoubtedly the most brilliant of any animal species but at the same time, it is also the most profoundly stupid. No other animal consciously destroys the very environment it is dependent upon for survival, except for the human. In our ignorant quest to destroy the planet, we are also causing the elimination of millions of other animal and plant species. Earth is currently in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. The previous extinctions, mostly attributed to climate change, killed an estimated 75% to 96% of all living things."
"We past the tipping point guys, too late"
"We need to act now and come up with better solutions like using waves for energy, getting rid of plastic wastes in oceans electric cars, creating less food waste, ride on bicycles, saving the ocean coral reefs, protecting our forests to give us oxygen to breath, build a link between climate change and racial equity, reduce carbon dioxide and fossil fuel, & stop coal mining operations."
Stop the chem-trails then.

Known fact! Why can't you fly over the North Pole?
Why don't planes fly over the North Pole to reach countries ...
The magnetic field lines near the poles are not aligned with the Earth's equator, making navigation challenging. This can affect the accuracy of magnetic compasses and other magnetic-based navigation systems used by aircraft. Why is it illegal to fly over Antarctica?
Is Antarctica a No-Fly Zone, and Is It Illegal to Fly Over Antarctica? Antarctica is not considered a no-fly zone because it is not illegal to fly over Antarctica. However, there is no reason to fly over Antarctica because it is not in the way to any airports and because it is not an independent country. Aug 30, 2022 Now ask yourself, why is that? So, you have the United Nations, which was set up by the Rockefellers and Rothschilds to have countries join together to do what? Tell more lies? Also, did you know that the Rockefellers were called once Rokershields, and the Rothschilds were called Rothshilds! The United Nations has such a unique way of Geniciding billions of people for the sake of what? Their agenda, so they really can control the masses! Remember, the Rockefellers and Rothschilds have been around since the dawn of the Great Pyramid! So, still think the world is round, or maybe, just maybe it's something totally different...I'm not saying it flat, but something else?"

MSM has lost all credibility 😂
Just like Russian collusion and the PP tape
😂 we are fckd...
"$178 Billion is only for ""Insured Loses"", the true economic losses are about $500 Billion a year. Plus if you add in all the Misery and Despair these events cause, you have quite the bill. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
The real problem ( and we were warned in the late 1970s ) is OVER-POPULATION . We were told we would reach peak world population by the mid 1980s and all of the things that are going on now would not be reversible if we didn't change back then . Even if All Countries stopped spewing bad emissions completely it won't reverse the Damage we have already caused .

"Fake ""scientists"" have been predicting doom forever.  HISTORY shows tbat tbey were WRONG.  We are STILL HERE Professor QUACK!"
Plants love more C02 :)
And every time we have a EV car catch on fire 🔥. Look at all the EV bicycle fires there are. Wonder how that will affect the environment. Insurance company are going to have a hard time covering a pyrow machine. Home owners and auto because to charge the vehicle it has to be close to the house.
Lol the climate scam 🤡
Man made climate change is a hoax
Try to convince people that climate change is real living in northern Minnesota. People here laugh when climate change is mentioned..😆
"I believe that somehow if we managed to keep the current CO2 level stable, that is around 420 ppm or so; the momentum of changes we have already made would continue to destabilize the climate to the point where passing several tipping points is inevitable.  The death toll from these changes will almost certainly amount to about 1/2 of the world population and, even worse, a reduction in the planet's carrying capacity to no more than about 2 billion people.  This will transform our current civilization to the point where the standard of living for most individuals will crash and kill off 90% of many countries.  Coupled with the kinds of demographic changes already occurring in nearly all developed countries, we should expect to see a peak population during the next 10 years followed by a rapid decline.  These changes are pretty well baked in right now.

On the other hand those people predicting the end of the human race because of these changes are being silly.  The more the population shrinks, the less impact people will have on the environment.  Unless the planet becomes a snowball earth like that happened several hundred million years ago, there will always be a large area of the planet capable of sustaining a sizeable population.

The problem really is that a lot of people will either lose their lives or their ability to sustain themselves comfortably.  The amount of suffering will be incalculable while the cost of cleaning up the mess becomes unsustainable.  By making judicious investments today, many, if not most, of these future changes can be avoided.  That should really be the debate.  Is it worth a trillion dollars a year to ensure this suffering doesn't occur?  We spend that much on making war so the money is available.  It seems to me that making our lives better should be more important but that is just me."
The polar ice caps are melting and will raise the overall level of the oceans. Maybe now is the time to think about converting all of this new extra H2O into Hydrogen gas and pure Oxygen and burn it off as consumable energy. The top one inch of all the oceans would have enough energy to run everything for man on Earth forever if it were converted into Hydrogen gas and Oxygen.
"You people just like misery, spreading misery and being miserable. There is no grim outlook. It is not possible to flood the Earth. Worst case scenario it all melted all at once. Nothing happens. There should be a federal law venting you from spreading this bullshit. It’s not right."
"Fear, Fear, Fear. Stop the lies. Climate crisis is a con. The climate collective is a dangerous anti Christ cult. People have been deceived into believing they are able to save themselves from a crisis that doesn't exist. However, this doesn't mean that the earth is not falling apart. God's word tells us ""For we know that all creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.""
Man should be fearful of one thing, God, who created them. And man should be worried that unless they are reconciled to God through Jesus Christ that because of their stubbornness and unrepentant heart, they are storing up wrath against themselves for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed."
Climate is not an issue truly.
"The world is going to end, and we are all going to die. Unless.... we spend more money, and make rich people richer. This is dumb. We all know it too."
The algorithm has provoked me with threats of an existential crisis.😊
I still remember that video of john podesta with the broom handle in the basement
Record how many times you fart in a week then figure up how to get your fart emissions down to zero.
"It's not ""The Big Story"" It's The Big Lie of the climate cultists"
I remember in the 90's these same experts said Florida was going to be underwater by 2013..🤣
"It's so cold in Canada.
If theres global warming I sure as hell couldn't tell."
I hope we go back to pre Industrial Revolution
Business-as-usual problem solving.  Let’s keep consuming and producing as much as we want.  But instead of fossil fuels we’ll mine lithium.  And keep the big capitalist mindset alive.  Sounds like we’re on track for increasing our doom for the sake of making money and keeping the status quo.
Its the sun and other cosmic entities that we have zero effect on but they dont ever bring thay up!!!!!
"semantics, anyone that believes that substantial changes will be made, in the face of profits is fooling themselves."

Humans can't save the planet. We can't even save ourselves with kindness towards each other. The earth has been here for billions of years. We won't be there that long....
Sigh
War has a huge carbon footprint. Ever heard a politician say we should reduce that to save the environment. Depleted uranium rounds aren't so good for the environment either. 🤷
Don't you just love the way the media whitewashes everything . If you want the truth about our situation on this planet. It is the ancient calendar systems of Lawless murdering War Pig Nations raping our planet to build their war machines while a child is starving to death every ten seconds on this planet.
"Climate Chaos is Global, there is no place that is ""Safe"" from it. And why would you have a Climate Panel without a Climate Scientist on it."
Hey more made up nonsense
can a black guy talk with out griping about disparate impact on blacks ?  I mean as soon as i saw him I knew what he had to say.....  It destroys the credibility of the whole report........the world is in danger....but  we have time to pander to black oppression on the subject.  That equity issue must be addressed first.....well then i guess it really isn't serious is it ?
"People Power has the potential to:
Make cheap clean power anywhere,
Reduce most unemployment anywhere,
Eliminate poverty through stored energy sales  anywhere. 

First what is people power? 

Power out from a storm or disaster?
There's People Power, any low tech solution that would bring power to any stricken area where people are. Wind and water turn wheels to make power, but so can people. Yes it can be stored ahead of time. Yes it's portable.  Yes it's inexpensive. Yes it's good for the environment. Yes it's safe.
People Power, free power in any emergency, anywhere there are people. 

Next...
People Power not only could make energy in an emergency power outage,  but that type of low tech could also store energy for future use.  That stored energy could be kept for backup, used in that area, or transfered and sold somewhere else. 

We also know that there are places in the world where many people need work.  Why not combine the two. Out of work people could be hired to use their physical power to make energy. They would not need much training, and virtually any healthy adult could do it full time or part time.
Next the extra money generated, could be used to buy solar panels to augment their revenues. 

What we must insure is that these workers are paid a fair, honest wage, and treated well. This can never be forced labor. 

Sum up: This is clearly a win win for everyone: Healthy power, many new unskilled jobs, and the end of poverty anywhere in the world,  all in a new power industry."
"Climate change has been going on longer then humans existed , before us volcanic eruptions effective Climate change more so then what humans will ever do ."
Republicans fault for climate change global warming
Don't worry here's the israel Palestine drink 🥃
I think we all know by now earth maybe has 150 years left
B.S.
"Math? Sorry but the IRA does almost nothing to reduce GHG emissions and $389 Billion will do nothing to change a $25 Trillion economy based on 80% Fossil Fuel Consumption. The numbers just don't add up. It is about 1.5% of what would be necessary, so really almost nothing. Especially when that $389 Billion is spread out over 10 Years (so 0.15% of what would be necessary) and the War Budget is $886 Billion every year, the Military is the largest institutional emitter of GHGs on Earth, so those are some weird numbers too . The correlation between global energy production and global GDP is overwhelmingly strong. A simple linear regression between energy production and GDP has a correlation coefficient of 0.997.You cannot run a $25 Trillion economy based on 80% Fossil Fuel use and expect 0.15% of GDP investment per year into Climate Stability to accomplish anything. Weirdest number of all? That the Biden administration somehow thinks these provisions will produce a 50% decrease in GHG emissions by 203O, that is comical in its stupidity."
"I knew the only way to wake up corporate America to climate change, was to measure it Financially."
"They probably just copy and paste the same report over and over again. It's been a grim outlook since the 80s, when I was actually worried about this stuff, and everything is still the same. Lol"
"80% of America's Electricity comes from Fossil Fuels, usually LNG. EV's are not Zero Emission Vehicles, there are significant Emissions in their Production and if The Electricity is not from Renewable Energy Sources, They are really not even an Improvement. Plus Mineral Mining and Production of  the Battery is Emission intensive too."
You played yourself.
Immediately climate change action and the children will suffer the pain from ignorance 🙏🙏
Jesus will save them.
I am beginning to see how everything the US criticizes in other countries is what the US itself struggles with and avoids acknowledging it pretty often.
The best thing to do is bankrupt the middle class to address this issue. Also use it as leverage to control the population through restrictive energy policies.
"The principle of climate justice emerges as a cornerstone, ensuring that vulnerable communities do not disproportionately bear the brunt of climate change repercussions and fostering a more equitable distribution of environmental impacts."
"It's everybody else's problem!
Don't look up."
All I hear is money money money
What a JOKE! We cannot change the climate or atmosphere you f tards! This is hilarious!
Its already to late.
"Congratulations, you've taken over from the religious zealots who warned me my entire life, repent, the world is ending. There's no difference."
Stop the lies !!!!? We do not trust the democraps or their goals !!!!
Really Fake News!
"Fossil fuels aren't the problem  , the ocean floors are warming up do to volcanic activities. Who are these experts 😂😂😂😂"
Welp.  We had a good run.
"Q: What is the reason doom and gloom is pushed so hard by the media?
A: Frightened, stressed, depressed people tend to buy more stuff, so advertisers will pay more $$$ to media outlets."
"Most of Canada was on fire all summer this year, 2023. The amount of CO2 created from that event alone probably blew out the optimistic prediction models needed & anticipated."
I’m glad to see so much skepticism to this BS.  John Podesta knows climate BS gives his side more power.
"Rubbish. Nonsense. Idiocy!
Within the last 24 hours I have also read a recent ""SCIENTIFIC"" report warning the world is about to enter another ice age period.
The so called science is not proven, the so called science is contradictory. 
These climate alarmists need to go and stand in a corner wearing a dunce cap!
Name a decade, or a century in which the climate did not change."
"Today (12/12/23) at COP 28, Russia, China, the UAE, and the Saudis vetoed any language about phasing down or eliminating fossil fuels. If humanity does not bit the bullet, make sacrifices, and act immediately, humanity will simply be gone...very soon...as soon as 2028. Climate change is now abrupt, exponential, and irreversible."
I blame Iceland. They had to open up that volcanic fissure. I thought this story was serious at first.
B#llshit!!!!! Biggest controlled scam in the history of ever.
"This report is the most liberal engineering piece of garbage you guys have ever posted. Viewers, read it for yourself and decide if it’s scientific or political. With these commies in charge, science is dead. Shame on you, ABC."
Lies.
"The endless climate mantra: ""Just you wait, it's going to be bad, you'll see"". Repeat decade after decade in perpetuity. 

The climate movement's tactic: Incessantly spew hyperbole and embrace fear mongering to obtain complete submission. 

This is a cult."
I know. So I’ll do my best and leave a positive mark in this beautiful loving giving earth before I ! pass .
I know how to fix this but no one believes me.

"John Podesta painted a great picture, but he missed the whole point. It's not enough! Sheesh"
United Nations? They're not credible. Fear mongering control freaks.
No one cares
Ain't no way... Podesta... Hahahaha
"Blah, blah, blah.
75 yr old John Podesta is not the best person to be addressing our nation's response to the catastrophic effects of global warming.
Someone with more skin-in-the-game than a 75 yr old man who has already lived most of his life would be a better choice.
At 75, John is not going to be here on planet earth many more years.
When today's youth are dealing with the consequences of his generation's actions, John will be long dead-n-gone.
The priorities of his generation is why we are in this mess and why things continue to worsen on his watch.
We need people with a vision for the future. 
A 75 yr old man has no vision for the future because he has no future.
Screw you, John.
Why is this geriatric generation in charge of our nation's response to catastrophic global warming caused by burning fossil fuels?
It's not even the bare minimum they are doing."
"corporate fossil fuel lobbyists rule. Bye, bye, until that changes, it’s all bull. Political rhetoric. Lobbyist are the anti democratic clause, and PACs, and…"
The comments speak volumes!
ABC = state-affiliated media
Every single time Biden opens his mouth about something I just completely disregard whatever it is he saying anymore. Trump wasn’t perfect by any means but I don’t even care about what Biden has to say. There’s nothing he could say or do that would ever make me vote for him at this point over Trump.
"What a crock of Biden Droppings. Even if Climate Change IS being affected by human pollution, these large companies have already made THEIR money. Charge them for their own cleanup and STOP FORCING RESPONSIBILITY onto the working class.
“Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an EMERGENCY ON MY PART”.
If climate change wipes the human race out of existence, then we obviously weren’t deserving of the PRIVILEGE of existing on this great planet.
Mother Earth will be just fine in time,should we destroy what keeps us alive. Perhaps that is what happened to the past technologically advanced civilizations.
Too smart for our own good!!!"
"gaslighting is the major cause of ""climate change"""
"Incorrect fact regards the biggest emitter of CO2 - it is China by more than double over the USA and then India followed by Russia.  The increase in forest fire has more to do with the poor management of our forests with the development of very high fuel loads.  The are a number of environmental issues that need to be dealt with, for example the ongoing impact of micro plastics on the oceans of the world , a problem that is going to take decades to clean up yet we still continue to use plastics and not some of the other biodegradable options out there.  Cleaning up the atmosphere needs to be a focus but the hysteria is reached a level that is laughable in a very sad way.  One has to ask who profits from the hysteria.  How about some objective facts and not photos of who knows where on the planet.  Give location information for each photo or video used in support of your presentation. This report gets a Forest Gump Award - Stupid as as Stupid does."

How about you succeed at fixing the potholes and roads and bridges and schools first? Take care of the basics FIRST and then we can talk about your absurd claim that you can control the climate f we give you more money and power.
It'll become a crisis by November of next year.
"Scientists will say anything for more funding and grants. What he  saying is we're going to be hit with  more higher  taxes on the people while the rich enjoy their luxury yachts private planes .

How about not making the purchase of private jets a tax write-off and instead tax those that feel the need to use this type of transportation frivolously.
"More bull from the government and media. Remember to prevent climate risk just wear your face mask. Remember dr fauci? Remember the science, remember CDC. Remember all the bullshit !"

Which is why they’re forcing anyone near the ocean to move out by raising everything sky high

Its called seasons.
Yeah yeah yeah .Here in California it is forest management.  Way to much dead brush. Fires started by human error
"Until our government gets the debt under control, and stop making millions off in their climate, they will never get anything done until that happens, the people in the Congress and our Senate spend money like it's nothing and they could care less , the people running the country do as they please and they don't care about the tax dollar."
FAKE Fear..it’s WEATHER.

"Why not look at what the temperatures in the US were 100 years ago.

But it doesn't fit the climate change narrative, so it is just overlooked.  
44% of the heat records for the various states are from the 1930-ties 
That caused the drought that Stenbeck is writing about in his book 'Grapes of Wrath'"

Propaganda. BS. Who believes mainstream news these days?

China has admitted to weather manipulation but our government possibly couldn’t do that too…
"Conversation about climate must include the greater world. US is 4% of the world population of 8 billion precious humans. Must also include facts about our love of forever wars. #1 polluting institution by far is the US military. Military emissions ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR REPORTING.Yet since September 11 US military has emitted billing ns of the ons of greenhouse gases pollution. Arrogant government spokesman lying. Methane has been spikeing for a very long time. Fracking alone spews millions of tons of pollution. Sickening how US talks down to the world, the world has had its fill of our violence."
Thank you for covering this!
CLIMATE CHANGE = FAKE AS HELL
"I just saw a documentary on the Romans; 2,000 years ago, the temperatures were an average of 7° HIGHER than they are now, with a small fraction of the people alive than we have today and no big manufacturing. The earth's climate changes. You can't stop it; you can only adapt."
Someone lile the President needs to address China's abuse of our climate. Socialism is not going to save us. Focus on the science.
Ok joe
😂
Lies.
The weather is very nice. We could use a little more global warming.
"funny enough, i been saying for year's its not how we gonna stop it, but how little of the warming we are gonna allow now.
but as i watch over the year's. so little has been done.
at this rate. i think the worst predictions might come to pass at this rate.
no one seams to care enough to save our own arses. or enough of us at least.
everyone goes, but our economy, well we not gonna have one if our environment collapses.
what's more important? money in your wallet? or food?"
"do you know about that thing that God did, that was really Genius  ?
he created Plants AND Animals 
you see plants suffocate when there is too much Oxygen or too little Carbon Dioxide. 
just like Animals die if there is too little Oxygen or too much Carbon Dioxide. 
Plants actually Flourish when there is too much Carbon Dioxide and increase their growth and ability to produce Oxygen. 
Plants remove Carbon from the Environment and Protect Animals including Humans.
Ingenious  ... and it makes idiots like these look like idiots !
plus ... as far as sea levels rising ... just look at a topographical map ... sea levels rising will not be nearly as bad as people lead you to believe. we might lose 50 to 100 feet of inland land mass on average."
what happened to TYT's climate reporterr? 🤡
It is very very sad... humanity will get what it deserves...
Vote green people!!
"Earth remembers what was done for VCR’s, electric stoves, and TV’s. For the unopened collectible trophies of Star Wars and Barbie dolls.

  Earth feels the attacks for our PlayStations, cellphones, EV’s, and solar panels. For our diesel engines, jet planes, and Halloween Costumes. 
 
 When the clock strikes 2.5 Celsius, Earth will drown PlayStations with her tears.
  When FedEx fails to deliver our packages due to washed out transport highways, Earth will not care that we are unable to give a one star review to Amazon due to internet being down.
  And Earth will not hear our cries over her thunder as we shout, “but we wanted to create economic growth and prosperity!” When the clock strikes 2.5 Celsius.

  Whisper the words 2.5 Celsius on every Bday, anniversary, and baby shower. Wedding, Black Friday and Xmass season, as the fourth fiscal quarter closes.

 _And then _*_Earth_*_ will say,…_
 “Through your actions you have forced me to wash myself clean of you as I will now ascend my warmth to 8+ Celsius. For my sixth extinction is now sealed.
  And it will be the extinction to end all extinctions.”

As we were in a mini ice-age during the 1600's and started to warm up from 1700 (not 1760) getting warm by 1.1C only brings us to the temps of the late 1300s (not the really super warm 1000's)

"It is interesting, both how this info was presented, and the tone of comments being made, fail to appreciate the gravity and scope of this impending disaster. It will negatively impact unforeseeable industries and communities, far beyond south florida and baton rouge. The humanitarian loss and displacement will be massive. The global human population, and everything it relies upon, will receive a substantial 'correction'. This has been known for decades, and no one in a position of power seems to care. This scenario remains as one of the main reasons i do not have kids. But hey... there are still profits to be made in dystopia, eh?"

Oh well its mostly places that dont believe in global warming. I wonder where they will run/swim but thats their problem.
"Hey, the Free Market™️ will save us!"
It’s all BS LIES. Tell us about all the volcanoes and erupting volcanoes under west Antarctica
"The danger of climate change isn't that it will make the world a lifeless uninhabitable husk. That's just infactual fear mongering.

The danger is that sea level rise will cause massive displacement and a worldwide refugee crisis 1000x worse than anything else in history, leading to massive instability, shortages of food and water, wars over limited resources, and the mass extinction of many animal species which will have consequences through the rest of the ecosystem like losing pollinators, disrupting growth seasons, and spreading of invasive species."
"You can say whatever you want, you can say that the climate change is a lie and so on, but, here on Croatia I grew up and up until the last 3-4 years or so, I NEVER have witnessed such weather extreemes like we have today. Never. We never have had such strong winds that blew our roofs off our houses, but now, such winds became regular every few months. Plus all the floods and extreemely warm winters. Up until 15 years ago we used to have A LOT of snow during the winter, but now, there's barelly any snow at all, appart up in the mountains. And it seems like this will only get worse, much worse."
"Agent Smith on the Matrix was correct, ""Humanity grows and consumes all of the resources in an area, caring nothing for the equilibrium of that area.  The only organism that I know that does the same is a virus."""

"More than 1600 scientists have signed a declaration saying ""There is no climate emergency""...100% correct."
"And we forget about the 133 million tons of oil, in rusting ww1 and 2 ships, about to break out of rusting hulks."
Once you start seeing the effects it's already to late.
the real cause of climate change is the gov't interference with the weather

"Once the world and ALL countries follow the same rules it will NEVER change. If you can open a factory in America or China ... But costs 50k more to do so in the USA cuz of pollution regulations you're hurting yourself, your neighbors and your own country..Cuz we ALL know you will build in china cuz its cheaper. Let your own citizens earn and work at the jobs. So global warming needs to be done on a world level"
So….It’ll take hundreds of years to melt but probably 50 years for the rise to begin impacting people. Still we need to do something bc a hundred years is nothing in the scale of overall history. Maybe we’ll have a better govt by then :/
Not enough people watch this channel

"It's only gonna get worse..... money rules everything, nobody cares and they all can be bought.....were all screwed"
As a person that was around in the 1960s when science started trying to get people to do something about climate change. As long as there is money involved there will never be anything done about climate change.
Florida would be underwater?  Good riddance.
The government was never going to do anything about it anyway there's nothing anyone can really do .
These are still climate MODELS. They talk about this as if its already happening. Its NOT.   They are saying oceans have risen 3.9 mm in the last 10 years....Really? ...lol...ok.
"As a religious colleague of mine once told me,  ""God will provide"" regarding climate change.   He was a highly educated electrical engineer.   At that point, I knew we were all screwed.  😢"
See. These ‘researches’ are always over-inflating their stories. Seen enough to become indifferent. Not saying they are wrong. They just keep coming with overhyped statements that they can’t be taken seriously.
"weather instability , 2 hurricanes on the pacific coast , higher humidity leading to heavier rainfall,
farmers can't tell if it will rain when it usually does. Longer droughts in some areas. This makes it harder to produce enough food. Temperatures too high to allow normal work. These are symptoms . Business trick workers to get new jobs and buy houses in hot dry areas while they buy land that was previously decimated by jobs collapse such as Detroit ."
"Too late. If we take all the emissions we can see out of the atmosphere, it will make things worse. Sea level rise will be the least of our problems. People will die from the heat."
"Tyt, can you share me some of your wealth so i could build a boat house?"

"Don’t believe them. He has obviously been drinking rather too much. Listen to him trying to speak, he seems confused?  Also. If you were able to travel to this ice pack, you would see that this story is all made up. By climate alarmists. These alarmists will stop at nothing, to needlessly scare people!"
So funny that people are stupid enough to deny the science of these reports when geological surveys have been showing this evidence for decades. Oh oh oh all the forst fires are fake right? The droughts are fake right? right? A civilization built on greed will get what it deserves. I guess it is what it is. What a gong show we have become.
I'm so glad i'm middle aged w no kids.
Big deal - this has happened many times before - Move
"This has been obvious for a while now, as was the fact we cannot stop it. Try all you want, you cannot stop greed on people in a few years, it's impossible."
Surely biden giving 10 billion tax dollars to Elon Musk to use his plugs is gonna save us all. The inevitability of Musk being the richest man in the universe because of this sweetheart deal will make all the bad stuff go away.
Of course
I knew the world was effed back in 2018.
Denial of climate change at this point makes you an immoral monster.
on a positive note Florida will be the first to go
good  i hope it happens  sooner  than they say

"If this happens and Florida is underwater, I can't wait to see what the right wing conspiracy theories about it will be. HAARP and DARPA? Is it teh Jooz? A plot by Joe Biden to steal the presidency? Hunter Biden's laptop? We shall wait and see."
"Climate? Simple Sobering Fact. After years in the Environmental Testing Industry working with Geologists, Engineers, Scientists, Climatologists and a lifetime of observation this is what I've learned.150-200yrs 1/2 to 2/3 of current land mass will be underwater or uninhabitable. Predictions made in the 50s have been taking place for 30yrs with early signs in the 70s. There is no mitigation... well past. Facts and nothing but the Facts. There's been warnings (Classroom Science Films) since the 50s. 20yrs ago we could ride snowmobiles from Altamont, NY to Canada (2 day ride), early snows were in Oct and shoveled my share of 2 footers on Thanksgiving. For the last 15 years there hasn't been enough snow to ride locally (never even a question back in the day) which is why I sold them and no longer ride. First snows are Dec and Jan now with no sustained coverage. Our addiction to convenience, being easily manipulated, and horrified by the thought of losing convenience has sealed our fate. Tipping Points Reached. Right now the Atlantic, Gulf, and Tropics are at temperatures (95°+ Sustained) and they're increasing, NEVER BEFORE SEEN. Land temperatures (115° + Sustained) from the Gulf to Canada, NEVER BEFORE SEEN. Navada: Tourists taking photos next to Digital Thermometer reading 136°, NEVER BEFORE SEEN. Many studies done on Coral which is why they're currently trying to Genetically Alter Coral to survive in higher temperature water. Heat is the #1 and quickest killer of Coral. During the tests they threw everything at Coral, garbage, pollution and nothing killed it until they raised the temperature 1.5 degrees and dead overnight. Why are they desperately trying to save Coral? Coral is one of the KEY building blocks of our Food Chain! So no need to change anything we're doing as it will be meaningless. Those of us who have young grandkids, the latter years of our kids lives will be pretty tough as habitable areas decline. The future for our grandkids is unimaginable. Everything they do will be based in survival and I'm not talking about Wall Street as there will be no Wall Street.
Now this is going to set off the deniers, If you want an Idea of what the late part of our childrens lives, grandkids and beyond is going to be like (Analogy! Not roadmap) Watch the Mad Max trilogy... in order. It's amazing how many Scifi movie depictions have turned out to be predictions. I regret I won't be around to say I told you so."
"Wait.
The dwarves released the Balrog?"
Florida is already a swampland so they're about that life lol they'll stay I bet.
"China. Yes, China. They make all the cheap stuff we can't live without, and that we couldn't afford it were made in the US. They power their factories that make the cheap stuff with coal fired power plants. Their mega-huge container ships have diesel engines the size of houses. Millions of gallons of diesel fuel are burned each time the ships come to America, to drop off the cheap stuff we want, which is then transported to the depots by diesel trains and taken to the stores by diesel semis. Thousands of times a day.
  If we want to end global warming, then everyone will have to stop buying cheap stuff made in all the countries that make it. That will cause a global recession. Millions of people will be out of work. That will cause starvation, strife, migration, wars.... Etc.
Either way, we're screwed. All of us!
  We can either die very slowly, by global warming, or quickly, by global depression (like 1929,but worse).
 Nature, the Earth, doesn't care how we die, because the Earth is timeless. In a few hundred, or thousand years, a more intelligent species(human, ape, sea otter, parrot, roach?) might populate the planet, and not repeat the past."

"This ""global warming"" is a natural cycle of the Earth. It's caused from the change of the Earth's axis - the tilt of the poles and the change of our orbit around the sun. When you look at eons of Earth's history, we've had MANY glacial ages, about every 100,000 years. Our last one ended 25,000 yrs ago. And we are still in it. Each age has had one, and there is nothing we can do to stop it. Look up Milankovitch cycles."
"Across the Lower 48 America tonight, the average temperature is scary -13 degrees below normal, setting more all time cold records after 2023's Longest COLDEST Winter since the 1880s, _-13 degrees the equivalent of 7 centuries of climate freezing._ We entered a Grand Solar Minimum. The hemispheres are covered in clouds. Look! Look! Northern nations will freeze, and burn wood pallets, praying to their gods. Le Minimum will last for a generation. 

_Open are the double doors of the horizon  Unlocked are its bolts  Clouds darken the sky  The stars rain down  The constellations stagger  The bones of the hell hounds tremble  The porters are silent When they see this king Dawning as a soul Open are the double doors of the horizon Unlocked are its bolts Men fall Their name is not Seize thou this king by his arm Take this king to the sky That he not die on earth Among men Open are the double doors of the horizon Unlocked are its bolts He flies who flies This king flies away from you Ye mortals He is not of the earth He is of the sky He flaps his wings like a zeret bird He goes to the sky He goes to the sky On the wind On the cold cruel wind._"

"It’s the end of the world as we know it. But that’s always how it goes. Cosmic events, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanos…it’s always a matter of scale. And it’s always subjective; from the perspective of people. The Earth doesn’t worry about us, and we don’t worry about the Earth. I’m not saying that’s a good thing. It just is what it is."

"This is off topic but a few years ago during covid and the debate over vaccines, hundreds of people in this comment section laughed and said they will happily see me die because I refused to take it. You said it was my fault people were dying and I will die. They laughed again. Here I am though, healthy, no swollen heart or any other problems. Meanwhile the drug companies that produced that poison are discussing bankruptcy and worse. I got covid and treated it with natural medicines. It sucked but I can sleep at night knowing there is no experimental dagerous toxins injected inside me. I want you all to know, just like I said back then. I forgive you and im sorry so many of you were fooled. So many trusting people were mortally wounded by those shots and they didnt deserve it.

But I'm sure TYT has their AC blasting in their studio today."
"Why wont the fake news report how they are manipulating our weather, shoving all the heat into some areas and making other areas, like where I live, cooler than normal. This has been the most mild summer I have seen in my life and Im 50 yrs old. Your narrative is failing, nobody with the exception of the brainwashed fools like the dumbass that commented before me. Those of us smart enough to look past your fake news knows you are manipulating the facts the same way they are manipulating the weather. We know how its done. Your lies are falling apart."

It’s called SUMMER. Untwist your panties
Another con orchestrated by the Zi0nists to fool the gentiles into submission and obedience. They are laughing at the sheep while they fly around in their private jets.
The claim that 99% of scientists agree is an outright lie. The majority of scientists are undecided.
Not my problem.
"We should react like we did with Covid. Panic, hate each other, hoard goods, oppress one another…. Maybe just kill each other no? Well… at the very least we should panic and shut down all means of production. That should help. Hey, guys…. You ever hear of the sun? It has sun cycles. Imagine being so narcissistic that you think you know everything about the planets history from less than 200 years of weather  records. Democrats think they are God. EVERYBODY PANIC AND IMPLODE ITS THE ONLY WAY. FOLLOW THE SCIENCE."
"its strange to hear that its hitting Miami, because I live here, and the weather isnt that hot tbh. Its been between high 70s to barely scraping the 90s. All in all, a cooler summer than normal."
Well looks like them animals better dip low in ocean
It’s not an act of God anymore… They know it’s human caused.! But they knew that all along and the insurance companies have made so much money because of it. People with money I just gonna ignore the boiling of the planet and the rest of us can go to hell. Or hell has come here.

Feel so hopeless. We are all so screwed. The rich have doomed us all.
Their oceans rose and rivers ran dry. Don't you see? They have no choice but to turn back the clock. We are responsible.
We seriously need some volcanoes 🌋 to erupt and cool it down...but I find it odd we think we know the entire Earths patterns and in all actuality we have only been studying the weather 150 years basically...
China broke the heat record by 3 degrees.

I can't live like this...🥵 I just saw this scientific video that pointed out the choice real estate of the future is actually going to be in Alaska and in Northern Russia. These will be the climates people will want to live in.
"Giant houseboat vehicles are the most selfish, repugnant things I've ever witnessed. What if fossil fuels are needed by future generations? Maybe in a thousand years, they might need some of it.

Only the people can bring real change. The 1% of the population living the life of greed don't give a dam they stupidly think they will be fine.
"Yet there are STILL climate change denyers.

"I look into the comment section, and am reminded of the wide horizon of hubris, denial, and  ignorance that has allowed this to happen. Sit back, relax, and let it burn; the planet's ecosystem will return to normal in a few thousand years after we've self-terminated. Any species that puts personal comfort, shallow greed,  and convenience ahead of responsible practices and common sense DESERVES to be destroyed."
Not afraid
They are playing you.  Saying it's hot week ever.  The people telling you won't change their lives.  Best example.  John Kerry got called out hypocrisy.  Then lied about it in front of congress.
"The pattern of this climate change is more of every kind of extreme, hot and cold, dry and wet. 

What you get depends on where you are on the globe, and which major effects in the cascade have already kicked in. What’s generally common is that the disruption of the long established ecology makes prosperity harder for organisms and societies adapted to previous history."

We haven't even hit the hottest month of the year--August--and we're already seeing heat-related deaths skyrocketing. It's only going to get worse.
"That last statement that humans were not around a 120,000 years ago. How could you make such a ridiculous statement. 

Modern humans 'modern Homo sapiens' evolved about a 160,000 years ago from 'archaic Homo sapiens' that date back some 300,000 years ago.

The evolution of man goes back even futher. But hey I guess 120,000 years ago this planet was a lifeless desert according to you. 🤦"
"Here comes the climate change fear ,just like that CNN journalist got caught undercover saying they use fear, and their next ouahnis for climate change.. . Keep trying the fear porn assholes...."

"I know that TYT are atheist, it was written 2 Peter 3:10 KJV
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up."
There is no solution though . Fusion Energy is in it's infancy .
So glad it's cool in the UK
..He'll fire.
This is the coolest summer going forward. Enjoy the nice weather.
The young Turks looking old as hell hahahaha 😂
While we chill over here at 60s ..... clearly something we arent being told
Absolute Lie and the people viewing this will prove it.
"Well if the lefties stop smoking dope and crack,stop burning down cities because some hoodlum with 30 felonies got shot, stop buying these electric cars that burn to the ground after hitting a mud puddle etc etc"
TYT is nothing but liberal ass bullshit
"I just read the comments of climate change deniers. The best answer to it would be a Rony Chang's quote.

""All these fu**ing D-average students who where at the back of the classroom their entire academic career. Stay the fu** in the back! You had every opportunity to prove yourself academically and you failed or were mediocre at best at every level. Why the fu** should we listen to you about anything? Let the neards lead! That what the nerds are for.""

Dear climate change deniers, your childhood experience of the weather, your understanding of climate or your 20 minutes google research are not as good as the PhD that scientists have. Stay in the back and let the nerds lead on this."
"THE US CHINA and INDIA are the worst greenhouse gas producers, USA has 330 million people, while CHINA and INDIA have over 2 Billion people . That makes American the most wasteful people on Earth ."
"And tack on all the wild fires across the globe for the last few years. 

""How can we sleep while the Earth is turning? How do we sleep while the beds are burning?""

Seems like this song is STILL fitting today. I know it is about Australia's Aboriginal natives, but the lyrics work for much more."
Been fine here in Wisconsin! Gets hot in the desert in the summer don't believe the BS!!!
"The entire planet? NO!!!

We have below average or just on normal temperatures here in Ireland and the UK.

2:57 it's not everywhere. It's in about 60% of the planet. As I said here in Ireland and in the UK we have normal temperatures for this time of the year or just below normal.

In fact it hasn't gone above 20c here with over two weeks."
Lieesssssssssssssssss
A comic news station tries drama.
Every July and August be very hot right now in Michigan is almost 100 so what happened put the AC on what is going to happen 😂
Greta is right!
"I live in New England.  Many of my set have taken the climate emergency seriously FOR YEARS.  We have been doing what we’ve been told will help, but there is a noticeable paucity of information in this regard.  We are and have been frightened.  WHAT SHOULD WE DO?  Fear mongering I can get from corporate media- I am hoping for instruction.  I am already terrified."
"Thanks  for taking this seriously. The insurance companies are just a symptom. Electric cars won't save us and neither will wind, solar and nuclear. We are already going over the falls. Unfortunately we are facing upstream so our view is a lot rosier than the reality of the crisis. You are right... BUCKLE UP"
"Cenk, rain and snow present sort of different problems."
I think it’s too late for humans we effed this planet up and are ignorant to what is going on around us.
You notice yearly increases? I do. Guess corporation fascist controlled goverments dont.
Quiet a few deniers are out at the moment under this video!
Climate change? Didn't technology do this to Vietnam back in the 60's? Imagine what they can do now.
Anyone ready to go vegan yet?   Animal agriculture is responsible for a whole lot of this.
"according to the right, it is all a hoax by 'the left' and the goal is to establish a 'fascist communist'(..) society where 'everybody owns nothing' and a great part of the people believe it. Meanwhile working on an agenda to reach a fascist society where some own everything.  You have to hand it to them (the right-wing sponsors) they are cunning ...."

"These are just the birthing pains as Jesus humanities Christ Messiah put it. 

We have already had the tsunami signs of Jonah. Lits fire lightning and brimstone sulfur are yet to come culmination with Noah's cataclysmic East to West deluges being pulled out and around the planet east to west by the new moon with the conjunction of mercury and Venus in 2033 and every 40 years thereafter for the millennium it takes to eclipse the nucleus of the Sun's Oort cloud magnetosphere.

1,000 years of peace if humanity accepts Jesus as their Christ Messiah.

The stones at Gobekli Tepe are crying out.😊"
"Global Warming scam fell apart.
All the Global Warming scamme'rsand politican crooks' waterfront properties are all still above water after over half century of ""WARMING.""
Now  they switch to scam slogn to ""Climate Change"", can't go wrong weith ""Climate Change"" - hot or cold, wet or dry = ""Climate Change.""
But the lefty self serving scam will never change.
BTW, these Climate scammers and politicians are mostly directly or indirectly fiancially tied to china which control all EV batteries production minerals and metals.. Now you know why they never once point out China is the biggest CO2 emitter and environmental polluters."
"At what point does violence against climate denying politicians, executives and billionaires become ethically defensible? Asking for a friend."
"It's not hot here in Addis Ababa, but the rain has been insane!😮"
Electric cars are not the answer. One major contributer that politicians won't address is short airplane flights. Stop offering 400 mile flights. Ban private airplanes. Ship by train instead of 18 wheelers.
12 feet of snow in July? Yea that’s science. Let me guess it’s because we didn’t vote for candidates endorsers by TYT?
"What really blows me away is that a lot of the deniers did in fact live through several previous decades, so they in fact should not need some pompous overpaid tv personality to tell them how things used to be compared to now. THEY LIVED IT. Just like I grew up in Michigan and saw the winters getting warmer each year for two decades. And how I've noticed the natural world slowly dying away for five decades. But nope, they'll listen to whatever the babble box tells them to believe like good little idiots, forget what they see in real life. Damned fools. When it all falls down, they will blame God. They'll cry and scream and wither as they slowly die, and they'll shout at the sky, ""What did we do wrong, oh Lord, to make you abandon us?!"" and God will go ""Hm? Oh... Look... they killed themselves. Fascinating."" and go back to daydreaming about a billion billion other worlds that had smarter life on them."
"I don't know if you all recall, most of the coast line should've been underwater by now according to ""scientists."" Yet, most of the rich/wealthy have lots of very expensive homes and property along the coast. Apparently they know that this bs isn't true, otherwise they wouldn't be dumb enough to throw their money like that. Also, if ""climate change"" is such a big issue, why don't they lead by example and get rid of their planes, helicopters, yachts and gas guzzling cars? Yet, we are the ones that suppse to give up everything? Wake up people!!! This is a sick and evil cult that seeks power, control and eventually the extermination of humanity and they will not stop untill they succeed or untill we all grow a pair and stop them!!!"
"Warming of ocean temperatures, seen around Christmas, is where the name EL NINO comes from.  I have been watching this for about 50 years.  It is getting worse EVERY YEAR.  Fossil Fuel profits are the most important!!"
"Cenk, you don't know shit about our climate.  Only twice in the last 8,500 years has the earth been COOLER than it is today, all the rest of that time it has been warmer.  The Northeast has suffered at least 10 major flooding event starting in 1927.  You dimwits act like this has never happened before and man made global warming is roasting the planet.  Nothing could be further from the truth."
Many of the world's most wealthy individuals are meeting now in Sun Valley UT but are there any scientists there?  Are they only discussing future profits? They should be talking about the state of the planet and how they could help
The oil companies have known about the damage to the climate for decades.   They believe profit is paramount to anything else.

"We can’t blame Biden for eligible voters NOT voting, for not sending the people needed in congress to do what needs to be done"
OK we’re subsidizing solar and wind but we’re still subsidizing fossil fuels and Joe Biden is forcing government employees who worked from home 100% from 2020-2022 to commute 2-3 days per week.

This does seem to be the year that the mainstream media finally caught on.
"HYDROGEN: Fuel cell electric Class 8 trucks are about to go into production by ticker NKLA. They use BOSCH fuel cells running on hydrogen (H2) with a couple of batteries. Fortesque, a billionaire mine owner from Australia is ramping up hydrogen production in the US, Europe, China & Australia. Both companies know this is how we go from fossil fuels to no carbon emissions. As it builds out price per KG will go down."

"Many people believe that all of this extreme weather is just a normal thing and will continue to believe this until it affects them. 

Governments will still treat things as business as usual as long as the money keeps rolling in. 

In the end though nature always wins and will forever win. I just hope many of you who think that everything is rosy survive until mother earth reaches equilibrium. Good luck out there."
NASA should get the hell out of the moon with its climate control of earth and forget the space police
"My friend is LITERALLY a nuclear scientist. She believes nuclear is 110% safe in 2023. Well, the newer plants sure. but mannnn we got some fossil plants out there too."
None of these climate claims are accurate all the inner planets are increasing at the same rate we have a very in expensive solution a 100million dollar solar shade will counteract the abnormal sun activity
"Thanks a lot for covering this. The nuclear question is tricky, but even if we moved toward nuclear power as a solution, it takes something like 30 years from start to finish to build a plant. Nuclear also requires a LOT of water -- in France last summer, they decided to allow their nuclear plants to continue discharging hot water into a river, exceeding the maximum allowed temperature (the river was drying up and temperatures were already warm). Naturally this can result in fish kills and other negative effects on the environment. If the plant has no water, it goes into meltdown, major bummer, or they have to shut it down, so no electricity. Plus, it assumes that humanity (and water supplies) will continue to be around to deal with nuclear waste and the maintenance and operation of a sophisticated power plant. OK enough about nuclear crap, we're screwed either way."

"The only thing more terrifying than the realization that Climate Change is officially here is the extreme stupidity of some of the comments in this thread.    PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY SEE FOR THEMSELVES THE EFFECTS OF OUR MISUSE OF THIS PLANET AND THEY STILL REFUSE TO ACCEPT REALITY.   They are as allergic to facts as vampires are to Holy Water.  

Stupidity.   THAT is what ultimately dooms us all."
"Climate and weather are not the same. Climate is a complex stable system that takes century's if not millennia to change. If a weather event falls outside of 1 standard deviation of the mean, then it's statically an outlier i.e., ""extreme weather"". So extreme weather CANNOT mathematically be the result of climate change."

You guys got to be kidding about the nuclear right? They are so many other ways nuclear????
"People, please don't blow this segment off!  Cenk and Ana, kudos for covering this piece.  The military has been leading energy conservation since the late 1990s, but it will take politicians to act now.  I totally didn't understand climate change or global warming when it was first discussed in the late 1980s.  I truly didn't give a poop back then; however, since the 2010s, I've come on board and am now a strong proponent of climate change.  It's real people.  

I believe in God and I had the same negative attitude toward climate change or global warming as many Christians still do today.  Nevertheless, God made us stewards of the earth, to care for it like the animals and fellow human beings, but now we're destroying it.  We Americans are mostly to blame.  It is predicted that the earth will dissolve by fire.  Most people think it will be destroyed by nukes; however, looks like it will be destroyed by fossil fuels, fracking and drilling to the abyss looking for oil and coal.  But there is a ray of hope, though.  We now have instruments to capture megatons of carbon monoxide, but we have gigatons of it in the atmosphere.  It'll take 50 years to get it to pre-industrial levels, provided we act now!  May the force be with us."
😆🤣 love to see it. I want to see more. Hahahah
Look at these people crying about climate change but they support the war Ukraine and somehow that justifies their climate what the f*** is wrong with you

Maybe the insurance companies should start to lobby for green energy?
And chances are we still won't do anything about it.
Diverse geoengineering technologies will be required and the longer we wait the more damage and less chance of successful restoration of climate.
"Stop trash talking nuclear. You guys are only pumping the gas on destroying the world with that talk. We could have made so much more progress if people would educate themselves about this instead of fear monger and listen to the scary made up stories coming from Hollywood or The Simpsons. Nuclear is the safest and cleanest out there especially with some of the newer tech that's been developed. Anyone not in favor of nuclear is just not educated and they are MAJOR contributors to the mess we are in. Nuclear is literally the only option we have that can make any solid impact. This TYT video not only did nothing to help and offered no solutions, but also made people with concerns about nuclear feel validated."
Consume less.
Nothing can be done now! Its to late!
Cows need to stop farting....................... Oh and also so ban gas stoves.
"The Nuclear Plants need to be closed to prevent even more danger/damage when it hits. Check out the Underground Cities under construction right now. You Wont Believe Your EYES. Then asked yourself, Why are these Cities being built all around certain parts of America ? Think about the weather last year, then the  weather this year so far.I mean Really Check These Things Out. They're No Joke.      "
"In my area many farmers started putting in drain tile systems because fields where getting so much rain in the spring they couldn't be planted properly or in the fall they couldn't be harvested. This year the spring was so dry some of those same fields with drain tile have massive bare patches because the seeds never germinated.

 The vast majority of fields around here have no irrigation because we got plenty of rain in the past. Now we are facing flooding fields or droughts."
It's the end of the world
You know whats more costly than taking steps to mitigate climate change? Climate change.
But let's drill new pipelines
"Few points. Not a fan of nuclear energy, but I would tolerate almost anything to get our CO2 emissions down, but nuclear is a really poor option. Too expensive and take, way, way, way too long to permit and build. The same money and time, would provide many, many times more wind/solar/battery electricity than a nuclear plant. But, sure, throw everything at it. (Also nuclear makes a very poor partner to renewables, as it can't be cranked up and down.) To 'The climate has always changed', folks: True, (but even taking into account, that apart from asteroid impacts, it has never changed at anything like this rate.), but the question is, 'Would you prefer we kept it like it is, you know the climate that allowed us to develop our technological civilisation, or would you prefer sea levels rise and flood every major city on the planet (well most)? (I know, Ben Shapiro, has told you that underwater houses are going to be prime real-estate when you want to sell up and move inland.) Your house will eventually rot and fall, but would you fail to fix a leak, because 'well nothing lasts forever'."
Very important point to make. It’s not just the scientists talking. The insurance companies are seeing it and saying adios.
We all will be Black in the future. Racism solved.
TRUMP DOESN'T BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE HE WILL KILL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIKE HE DID WHEN HE DOWNPLAYED THE PANDEMIC
Theres no hope with reversing climate change. We missed the boat back in the 90s to transition and now the chickens are coming home to roost. Most of our politicians are all corrupt too old and dont care. The only thing we can do is try to adapt now.
There is tide energy and many other alternatives. Nuclear energy had accidents that last thousands of years to recover.

IMO."
No one questions why or how it's considered normal for an entire continent to be uninhabitable and covered with glaciers and thick permafrost. We are and have been exiting an ice age. The earth is returning to the norm that existed prior to the ice age.

One galactic year holds all of our clues to what happened before!
Basically everything before fossils is just rocks bouncing around put the puzzles together! Because of life we kind of know what happened in the last two galactic years!  Life spring up!!

"So why are all the political experts buying beach houses if the ocean is rising? It should have flooded 60 years ago, according to the so-called experts!"
😂😂😂😂.   Sea level rise is currently like 2.5mm per year and has been for at least 120 years. Oh by the way glaciers started melting in the early 1800’s one century after the the low point of the little ice age around 1695. And also the Dutch know how to live under sea level.
Not true . The Earth has undergone FIVE ice ages. The other four melted at a much faster rate than the one we just experienced.
So Manhattan will be underwater soon once the meltwater gets over here right?
"Elon musk shot 4000 satellites around the earth, does that have anything to do with this? Or the ozone is broken and the UV index is burning off leaves and causing global warming"

"“ The North Pole will be ice-free in the summer by 2016 because of man-made global warming. “ Pathological liar Al Gore, 2013."
"Meanwhile the fossil fuel companies are planning to expand production 10% by 2030. Just this past year 2022 set a new CO2 global emissions record of 40.5 billion tons. The Earth's plant life on land & sea uses about 16 billion tons in photosynthesis annually, so the other 24.5 was added to the mountains of tons already emitted. And if you think it could all stop on a dime if we somehow stopped emitting CO2 - it has momentum lasting decades. I'm not saying we're doomed, I'm saying we need to find a way to change our energy sources fast."

It’s gg
Kinda hard for me to care about melting glaciers when we are trying to put food on the table.
Thank God we now have more government (office of environmental justice) which will definitely not be a grift of tax payer money. Also we have our glorious media to tell us the truth just like they did during COVID-19. 😂 I cannot express my contempt enough. Print money scare gullible people and limit freedom will be the answer like always.
"You say this every year and every year NASA proves you wrong.
Besides, you were just crying about ""droughts""."
I forget is this the 4th time the ice caps were going to be melted in a couple years or the 5th? I keep loosing track on account of them moving the goal post every 5 years and then raising the taxes that only effect the middle class.
Was Al Gore the leading scientist on this?
Support your local climate change. Change is good.
I say let the world's glaciers melt. Let's see how humanity deals with the outcome 😏
Snowed in southwest Michigan last Monday. April 17th.
"Riiiiiiiight. You do realize, that the climate has been changing ever since, well, there was a climate, right?"
Out of curiosity what caused them to melt the dozen or so times before we were here?

"Wow... Odd huh... I looked up lighthouses old pictures 1900 & Earlier and the shoreline hasn't changed in over 120 years enough to even be noticeable. 

Seems the real conspiracy theories  are found in the so called ""science based"" sites and the fake media. 

I guess if it's reality based facts used it cuts into the fear mongering ""non-science based"" tax money scamming by ""climatologists""...

Shrug...

Snowed yesterday. It's getting colder.
Nothing will be done cause the rich don't care
Fake news
Fossil fuel companies spent over 100 million dollars last year on climate misinformation! Ask yourself WHY THAT IS??
Jesus is coming soon.....repent
Anyone who believes the UN or IPCC needs to have their head examined. Both are institutions whose primary aim is to bring about global totalitarianism.

Its been melting for centuries nothing new. It will be gone soon. No more weather problems because the ceiling height will be even.
I'm not sure but another feet of water in NYC does not seem like much.
We do have man made climate change. It's called weather modification.
"Strong EL Nino for beginning of 2024. Since 1600's this weather pattern has been known about.

El Niño can affect our weather significantly. The warmer waters cause the Pacific jet stream to move south of its neutral position. With this shift, areas in the northern U.S. and Canada are dryer and warmer than usual. But in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Southeast, these periods are wetter than usual and have increased flooding.

Sounds about right."
Climate change and I got a vaccine to sell you for covid to 😂
"Well, it is almost Spring. Just sayin is all."
It's called Biden economy....
Climate change uses less fossil fuel to heat...correct?
"Romans 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 

Romans 6:23
For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

Acts 8:37
And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 

Romans 10:9
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 

 Corinthians 15:3-4
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 

Ephesians 2:8-9
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Loss of winter traditions will cause societal collapse. No more shoving homeless people into the frozen tundra this year😭. Thanks Biden
Traditions...lol. The U.S.- Where traditions go to die.
I guess this station didn't get the memo that moving all of those thermometers to the hottest parts of citys to further this climate change hoax was uncovered recently.

a story about thin ice with a minivan parked on said ice in the background. lol.
How sad ... 🐟 ...
I remember when the flintstones would stop ice fishing to invent the wheel so they could drive across the land to fish further north due to lack of ice and snow caused by climate change. It was a total tragedy.

"Vermont has terrible floods and is seriously racist.

"𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗚𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗱
A few days ago, the papers warned that Europe is facing the worst drought in 500 years. They described the dry and hot weather and the fires that broke out all over the continent and spoke of an apocalypse. Today, they are reporting flooding in London and violent storms in France causing catastrophic flooding, where in some places, more than an inch of rain fell in less than 30 minutes, and in Paris, a storm with 65 mph wind gusts and nearly 2 inches of rain that fell in just 90 minutes flooded the Metro. Clearly, the climate has gone mad.
However, the climate did not go awry by itself, but because of our madness. Nature’s erratic behavior merely reflects our own agitation toward everything. Our growing narcissism drives us to treat everyone and everything with utter indifference to the needs of others. In fact, we even enjoy hurting others. We think that if we can use others and not see the consequences for our actions right away then there are no consequences, but there are very serious consequences for our wrongdoing toward others.
In the closed system that is the world we live in, everything we do affects everything else, and that effect returns to us like a boomerang. When we pour so much negativity into the system, it becomes dysfunctional, and this summer, we are experiencing this dysfunction through the smoldering heat waves and torrential rains. If we continue to flood the system with hatred and intolerance, we will not need nuclear weapons to wipe us out; plagues, natural disasters, fires, and floods will extinguish us long before we extinguish each other.
When the summer is gone, winter will come with its own perils, and lack of gas and power will wreak havoc in Europe. Eventually, we will have to accept that we cannot defeat nature; we cannot outsmart it. We will have to learn to be an integral part of nature, connected to each other and to nature. We will not survive otherwise.
Since the only element in nature that has bad intentions and an exploitative attitude toward others is us, we must begin to change our relationships. Our attitude toward the rest of nature stems from our attitude toward each other. Therefore, if we are considerate toward each other, we will be considerate toward nature. It turns out that the correction of our tormented planet begins with the correction of our broken ties with one another.
To mend them, we must put our heads together and discuss solutions on a global level. These solutions must be inclusive and take into account everyone's needs. At the same time, everyone must accept that they cannot receive more than is necessary, since they, too, must be considerate toward others.
To get such a global initiative off the ground, there needs to be an open discussion about it all over the global media. People must know that we really are running out of time, and unless we ‎ change now, it will be too late afterwards.‎
I do not know how to keep this move clean from politics and politicians, but it has to be a ‎genuine effort to save humanity and the planet, not a ploy to take control of it. Perhaps a panel of scientists will be able to make this happen, but they, too, must work without ulterior motives.‎
I realize that this idea may sound naive, but I also realize that if we do not take global action to sincerely improve our connections, the approaching annihilation is certain and near.‎"

"https://youtu.be/5eO2uNnL5R4. This is how the fog look like. just remember, every 1 gallon of water through our system will be turn into 1,500 gallons of that fire-suppression agent. It is non-corrosive, non-conductive, and drinkable. This is the very fire-suppression agent to put out the EV on fire instead of using water. The freeway will be soon full of EVs, and there will be more accidents, and fires. It takes around 30,000 or 40,000 gallons of water or more to put out on EV on fire. Where do our firefighters have those water on freeway when their fire engine can carry only 1,000 gallons of water? The water scarcity will be worst, if we don't have the right solutions. Go ask the governors in states that have wildfires, and droughts. Do they think about this situation?  How they solve them while our farmers don't even have water for farming ?"

"The human primate is undoubtedly the most brilliant of any animal species but at the same time, it is also the most profoundly stupid. No other animal consciously destroys the very environment it is dependent upon for survival, except for the human.

The previous extinctions, mostly attributed to climate change, killed an estimated 75% to 96% of all living things."

"by highlighting  fires and floods isn't enough its the pollution caused by industry that pollute land and waterways. in the case of fires once the trees are gone in the west fires will become less and less year on year, but the pollution of land and water lasts decades if not centuries.  then worry about what your drinking we need water but at what cost?"
Since Trump became president these wonderful people have dealt with massive fires. 4 years. This seems odd to me. Are they intentional? Who started them? I don't believe in coincidences...
They arrested people setting fires but say nothing. Land management reduces fires but they don’t want trees cut
To all that care about climate change just remember hope without action is a dangerous thing.

climate change is a hoax.
"biden : easily influence pervert
trump : never read very smart guy
what the option again ? ...."
The intro omg
"People don't understand  that  climate change is a fabricated crisis. A hoax which  started within think tanks (social engineering) .... ..and was force fed/propagandized through the establishment mass media to the public.

Climate change is interest/power driven, not a science based crisis !

The hypocrit gravytrain science community, which knows better, is pressured and blackmailed to play along !

Every dissident scientist is muzzled and censored by the bought and paid for establisment mainstream media and academia. Their psychopathic billionaire overlords seek to make even more money, rule out competition and roll out their fascist oppresive agenda 21-30 on the world !

IN Searching For A New Enemy To Unite Us, We Came Up With The Threat Of Global Warming” | Climatism
“IN Searching For A New Enemy To Unite Us, We Came Up With The Threat Of Global Warming”

“The common enemy of humanity is man.
In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up
with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming,
water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these
dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through
changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome.
The real enemy then, is humanity itself.“
– Club of Rome,
premier environmental think-tank,
consultants to the United Nations

“Isn’t the only hope for the planet that the
industrialized civilizations collapse?
Isn’t it our responsiblity to bring that about?”
– Maurice Strong,
founder of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP

it is a cult!"
"Everyone knows there is climate change. It’s debatable about the effects that would have. However, The issue is that nothing dems have suggested even at the most radical view will make one bit of difference. And would ruin our country. Renewables can’t produce the power we use and costly; nit sustainable kinda cost. We will need innovation that is nit possible with the regulations dems put on nation. Why Elon musk left ca for tx. Trump had the USA under the limits set by the Paris accord anyway. Going back into it only eliminates jobs for no reason. Currently the only sufficient renewable that would suffice us nuclear energy. But guess who is against that? Biden and dems have and will ruin job Griowrh and induce power shortages fir the sole purpose of of virtue signaling. That is the democrat party theatrics without substance ."

Bro the economy isn’t going to change because of climate change. Their main agenda is money. They don’t care about global warming. Remember millionaires are investing in ways to leave this planet.

"why do you spread these lies? we cannot refreeze the arctic oceans. we cannot refreeze the tundra of sibera, we cannot stop all the  positive feedback loops that are in place and happening now. there is no way to stop these facts from being true. we wont make it more than 5 more years.  these people should not be allowed to rebuild. it will burn even worse next summer. and the summer after will be worse. people, you waited too long!!!!"
"This is KARMA to USA for recklessly using their H.A.A.R.P ., a weapon for mass destruction. .HAARP can alter weather, cloud formation, cause earthquakes, tsunamis, and cause hurricane/typhoon?"
No no no not every young person is in par with this nonsense
"Every time i see something like this i think just about the only thing we can control are the fires that burn. When there hasn't been much rain all we have to do is watch where we do things in areas WE KNOW are very dry (throwing cigarettes out of cars, camping etc)  We can't do anything about lightening strikes. Other then that we aren't in control over anything else. We can't even control the temp of the earth no matter what we do."
Climate change is obviously real but these fires are due primarily to poor forest management by states that have cut their BLM funding significantly over the years despite having outrageous taxes. They will never tell the truth and take responsibility.

The fires are natural? Are chem trails natural?
"People keep blaming fossil fuels, like oil and coal but no one saying anything about population growth on this planet 🌎 We’re talking about people that want the American way of life and trust me they’re going to do whatever it takes regardless of what’s, going to happen to their local environment. in their countries to achieve a first world status, rate of living. Like it or not by 2024 the planet will have 8 billion people and by 2050 Africa alone will have 4.5 billion people how do you feed water and give energy to that size of a continent Without oil or nuclear energy sad to say nothing can be done about climate change"
"People keep pinching eachother...about their race,color,religion...where they need to act together for global climate changing"

"This was a fantastic show, you all did a wonderful job if we could just get started on this! You need to send a copy to both Joe and Kamala!! Fantastic!"
Little commie bishes are setting fires just like in Australia. Pelosi's Chinese buddies own the dams and would let the ausies use the water. Green deal is a commie ploy there's a lot of them we've been hit by a bunch this year. They want U.N. control of the 🇺🇸. Commies run NY and Portland. Stop being wusses.

Please Confess, Repent, & Believe in that these are the end times. It is only just the beginning."
Wait a minute!!!! Are we surpose to fill bad for the people that lost homes or happy I'm confused. Cause It look like it was a come up for them.
Any and all who deny climate change need to be removed from office asap because they don't care at all about the people they say they represent. It may be painful economically but our personal comfort now is not a morally justifiable stance to make life of our children and children's lives that rough. If you research what we are being told and the reality it is gonna be far tougher on the future populations that what most believe. Economic growth will most likely be from industries countering the affects of climate change furthermore if you aren't aware climate change has been a multi billion dollar industry for years now folks.
Climate change has been impacting mankind ever since we came out of the caves.
Makes me wonder what all the climate fanatics are doing to limit their destruction of the world. Household trash.  Walk/bike?.  Do not fly.  Electrical energy use?  Heat?  A/C?  Fast food (lots of trash there).  Extensive list......
The main culprit of climate change is ChemTrail.
Good thing antifa fires are bringing this to the forefront so we take action. Climate is about people and corruption. It's about using the slave culture to promote international corporations at the expense of our economy. No one should have to work. Work and the economy depleats our prestine enviornments.  It's about influence paddling and China which is driving democrat politics. Climate change is radicals looking for a horse to ride.
"1) By reflecting away 30% of ISR the albedo, which would not exist w/o the atmosphere, makes the earth cooler than it would be without the atmosphere like that reflective panel set on the dash. Remove the atmosphere and the earth becomes much like the moon, a 0.1 albedo, 20% more kJ/h, hot^3 on the lit side, cold^3 on the dark. Nikolov, Kramm (U of AK) and UCLA Diviner mission all tacitly agree. 

2) the GHG up/down welling, “trapping”/”back” radiating, 100 % efficient, perpetual warming loop requires ""extra"" energy which it gets from 

3) the terrestrial surface radiating that ""extra"" energy as an ideal, .95 emissivity black body which

4) it cannot do because of the non-radiative heat transfer processes of the contiguous atmospheric molecules. 

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 0 RGHE + 0 GHG warming + 0 CAGW. 

All science backed up by experiment, the gold standard of classical science.

"It's more than just heat and drought. Fires like this and this common can only be produced in the most artificial way. Climate engineering and the multitude of effects it has is a key factor. The chemicals sprayed by the planes such as aluminum, aluminium, barium, and strontium are flammable chemicals. They also act as desiccants (they dehydrate) and interfere with the hydrologic cycle (causing drought)."
Climate  change does not choose a race or nationality.  Australia got hit with fires last year. Climate change and Covid 19 does not discriminate.  Please stop the fake news.

It’s summer……….duh
"You don't know what hot is. I grew up in thermal California, in the Coachella Valley.
Second hottest place in America, only to death Valley.
Stop your whining.
It's not that hot."
We've always have had heat waves. Where temperatures reach 100 or more. I do not know the year but in the early 1900s in Ohio. It was so hot people went swimming in the nude and were arrested. But it looks like we're still here.
So lets do some blocking out sunlight & solar panel efficency will increase by 75%.

So far this has been a very mild summer in my opinion

What started the end of the dust bowl?  1937 Hitler started the second world war and to end this tyranny we set half of the world on fire, releacing enought co2 into the atmosphere that the plants weren't starving.  So the quote "" we will know that we have succeded when everything the people believe is a lie"" applies here also!"
Why are we acting like these Temps aren't normal for a summer... oh my God miami hit 100* degrees in the summer smh
BS! Quit pushing a lie.

Way to go ABC for spreading BS! You’ve become a disgrace to news! These are just seasonal cycles and have nothing to do with climate change! Keep sucking this administrations toes!
How come when it comes to global warming no one ever talks about the real reason? Its overpopulation. Way too many people. Its a trickle effect. More cars. More electric. More food. More everything. But the government and tree huggers will tell you its cows farting and fossil fuels. Im pretty sure my car will never give off in a lifetime what one stupid rocket to mars does in one launch but thats over looked. We dont need scientists. We need common sense.
Good.  Cue Tool’s AEnima.
"The ""news"" that this talking head is reporting is ""unofficial"" according to articles by the AP. If the AP won't claim it as fact, you gotta say ---Hmm?  Maybe this is just more climate change misinfo. A few years ago, NOAA came out with the claim that when it had finished computing temperature records from all of its national weather stations it was discovered the the temp. had risen.02 degrees F in 1 yr. 
     Then, someone who was very familiar with that equipment used by NOAA said, ""hold on a minute, the equipment that NOAA uses can't measure to that degree of accuracy."" Noaa admitted that the accusation was true but there was a 38% chance that their claim was correct. That hardly makes it's claim a fact --- more like a lie. & that, coupled with proven EPA half truths is the reason that I don't believe crap like this ""news.""
     While I'm here & wound up, how did all of this global warming crap get blamed on the human race? Over billions of years this sort of thing has happened numerous times on earth---- without the human race even existing? Now the same phenomenon is man's fault? Bullshit, humans may have contributed to the problem but we're not going to cure it. It is ignorant & the ultimate vanity to pretend that the human race is that omnipotent."
I wonder who or how many people will survive when the climate get real bad and it will get real bad.
The earth is going through Grand Solar minimum.  This propaganda programming and weather manipulation has to stop!  Chem trails are real.  Research!
Awesome!

"Nothing but Fear Porn. The hottest years on record were in the 1880’s and 1930’s. Weather changes, stop gaslighting us Far Left Fascists. You just want total control of our lives. Leave us alone."
Funny thing is Idaho has had lower temperatures and more precipitation than we have had in decades. I call bullshit on this global warming agenda. EV’s are supposed to save us yet they have a huge carbon footprint even though they are free of fossil fuel usage. It’s all a political agenda by the democrats to make money. As if everyone in America can afford to go buy a new EV and junk their gas powered vehicles. Then not to mention the electricity that will have to be produced to charge them when we have a shortage of electricity just to provide for people’s homes. This mentality is stupid and nowhere near feasible with our resources. We need to go back to the drawing board and figure something else out.

"Don't listen to this nonsense.
They're lying to us to push the politics of climate change.  Where I live, this past winter was coldest on record for a few days.  It was not that hot here last few days"

"This is "" You better get triple vaxxed and boosted or we are all gonna die"" all over again....Notice it's the same crowd of  globalist shills  that push this climate crap ,too, and the same group of Sh*tLib mouth breathers that believe it without question. Coincidence? Doubt."

Global warming is scam for power and money. Do you think the government cares about you? No.
"Bullcrap, it hasn’t even been that hot where I am. This is all just to get the climate activists riled up so they can take away things from people in the same of “climate change”."

What's more important - fossil fuels or an ozone layer that protects us from the scorching heat of the sun - clean air-water & arable land?
Sad to say it's already too far gone to fix the irreparable damage the fossil fuel industry has already knowingly intentionally caused."

It’s not as those kind magician predict time of things happen, it’s no time line in universe and explosions on sun effecting very much planets movement and shifting of tectonic plates could happen any moment as already has increased for two years!!!
That is the problem with science, they boxed in one direction and don’t know the real thing about earth!!!
Everything is chained like our human body all organs and everything plays roles in human body lifecycle!!!
It’s so simple but you people make all that very hard and impossible!!!"
Well i mean winter is over..
"It's doubtful that humans will find the balls to actually tackle the problem head on and change things for the better, already most people have plastic in their systems and no one gives a toss!"
There are almost 9 billion of us living on this earth. There are just too many of us. Everyone keeps selfishly making children.
"We need to build the biggest air conditioner and power it too save the planet. There’s the idea, now let’s go team"
It was already too late in 2016. Now just wait and watch.
"main reasons
1. over the last 2 years, the EU has massively abandoned Russian gas and replaced it with coal-fired power plants, but at the same time farmers are being forced to reduce their livestock numbers!

2. Sabotage against 3 strings of northern flow gas pipelines led to a huge metonic blow to the climate. This is a major environmental crime, because in less than a week, a volume of methane equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 5 million cars per year has been released into the atmosphere. According to Danish experts, the volume of leakage is equal to 30% of annual greenhouse gas emissions in Denmark, and for Sweden the same figure is 80%."
What is the impact of Ukranian  war on the CO2 level?
Imagine being so arrogant that you think you can control the temperature of a planet and pouring in money into that delusion instead of finding ways to adapt to the changes.
CHI-NA
"there's nothing wrong with the climate or temperature, this is the biggest fraud in the history of mankind"
Going into the geological normal of swampy and hot atmosphere
Thank goodness I don't have children.
I live in the Caribbean and 2023 winter was my warmest winter ever lived
That's because of war in Ukraine.
"Maybe if the change is expressed in Fahrenheit instead of centigrade, Americans will care more."
Not taking into account the bombs going off continuously in wars and show of force training in the last 2 years.
"If the climate change won't cause a world war, nothing will."
More lies and hyperbole from fanatics.  Don't believe any of this garbage.
Lol
It will happen faster than they thought.
What's completely missing from these reports is the sources of the greenhouse gases pollution. Convert all fossil fuels energy to their oil equivalent energy and find we're going through 100 billion barrels of oil equivalent fossil fuels energy annually. In order to feed 8 billion with another 80 million net new precious humans joining us every year we must have huge quantities of methane to convert into fertilizer. We would never have been able to get to this many humans with man made fertilizer. Many other civilization critical molecules are derived from fossil fuels. Yet we're burning these precious molecules for transportation and electricity when there are better ways to move people and products. Better ways to provide electricity. There is no Fossil Fuels Fairy refilling the holes. The old men addicted to endless endless war are killing the Earth's ecosystems in their lust for power and love of violence. The citizens of these nations must regain control over this grotesque man-made catastrophe
I fear for my 17yo daughter and all young people tbh 😢😢
"Turns out that the leading cause of climate change is hot air. Main sources of hot air  are Davos, Brussels, New York, Washington and Beijing.  Don't trust politicians to solve problems and stop useless fearmongering. The climate will change, pretty sure those goals set by COP etc. won't be reached. We need to prepare for an instable climate  and adapt to it."
And just like I thought no real data. To be convincing you need to show charts and graphs. And not just 1 or 2
Leute bitte hört auf mit Schiffen zu fahren ... So scheiß wie Kreuzfahrten sollten verboten werden
Too much concrete not enough trees. Cutting down Forest and wildlife for human expansion
atleast we dont have to worry about retirement
Yaaay! new decades long continued winter all year long incoming 
The rich say this while they fly their private planes and yachts…. We all know what the real problem is.
It is already too late.
The answer is right in front of us in the form of nuclear power.
And the only thing that help to cool down are trees but they cut them down for “Renewable” energy. It takes 25 years to regrow !!!! and one power plant use 625 ton per day! That are 416 trees just burned for “clean” energy 🤮. You can better use oil/gas/Coal and plant new trees to absorb CO2. Wake UP people.
None wants to stop our production. We will stay on the wall waiting the Tzunami
Lies
"1.5 is arbitrary. 
The warming of the last year is, as in the report, was due to El Niño, and we are now entering La Niña. 
The Earth was warmer in the recent and distant past. It warmed faster in the past."
I blame Australia
LOL this WEF groupie channel xD
"Every immigrant that crosses the border will increase their carbon footprint substantially. This footprint will increase exponentially as they have children. Additionally,  sending aid to foreign countries artificially supports an otherwise unsustainable population. If you really care about the earth, you would stop all foreign aid and close the borders."
"From 2011 up t0 2015 I watched in amazement as the world slowly shifted. What surprised me
is that scientists didn't warn people."
"To assuage the fear of drought in the Amazon can I point out from the latest research ""precipitation extremes during the preinstrumental nineteenth century indicate that recent floods and droughts on the Amazon River may have not yet exceeded the range of natural hydroclimatic variability."" (Granato-Souza and Stahle, 2023)? And let's take a moment to remember The “Forgotten Drought” of 1865, plus ""the recent river-level extremes on the Amazon may have been equaled or possibly exceeded during the preinstrumental nineteenth century."""
"The title says new climate date shows global temperatures continuing to rise sharply. Only did i not see any data on climate change and i did not see how do they aquire this data. All i see is people talking about data, but we do not see the actual data and how they got the data, how did they measure it, how did they come to their conclusion? Now i believe the climate changes, just as it has been changing in different ways and forms for over 5 billion years, and now the climate has been warming up for over 12000 years, that period is called the end of the last ice age. So it started long before humans industrialized. People worry about carbon in the atmosphere, they should know that only 0,04% of earths atmosphere exists oit of carbon. If that number drops below 0,02% then that would mean the end of all plant life on the planet because trees and plants feed on carbon. It is strange these climate alarmists and climate ""scientists"" never show you that data. As long as they tell you that you should buy this and that to save the climate then that is nothing more then commercial sales trick."
Why not spray aluminum powder on Earth's geostationary orbit? This will reduce solar radiation.
"In the fifty years I've been watching this, nothing has been done to stop it and I don't see anything being done that can stop the collapse of the ecosystem."
I am so sick of this. The higher ups been telling us it is cars and cow emissions.... when we ALL KNOW it is the industries who have gotten us here. I think it is finally becoming clear the boomers loved money more than their planet and I am sorry to say but now the Millennials and Gen A. will suffer. I am glad I will only be on this planet for a couple more decades because I fear what is coming!!!!
"Get ready for extreme cold because if it really is getting warmer, the Poles will melt, the water will go into the oceans and cool the oceans which will then cool the Earth a little too much.
It's the beginning of every ice age.
It's a cycle."
Don't be helpless victim. We all can plant on our patches. Embrace permaculture even on a small scale.  Eat less or no toxic (anyway) meat. Use natural products for cleaning and washing. Refuse to consume on a large scale to feel empty space Inside. Research plenty of info out there.
"Would people grasp the complexity of reducing an entire year of temperature data for the ENTIRE WORLD to a single number!?

Then add the complexity of statistical mathematics, which most people would be unable to understand.

Chiefly uncertainty & randomness, which the average human can't cope with. They struggle to debate politics beyond a choice of two parties!!

Then the media & politics & random opinions. Using words with diluted or confusing meanings, for purposes beyond the actual subject.

Like getting clicks & views."
Moving away from nuclear energy has been our biggest mistake. We need to do something.. Come on
Time to ban jet flights. Burning 100s of thousands of litres of jet fuel every day and depositing it directly into the upper atmosphere.
"What are you  wont  ...
No urbanisation no civilization  ...

"I'm in Eastern Canada and have heard of local farmers starting to quit. It has been one terrible growing year after an other, and the consistent lack of predictability of which wild weather/temperature we will get makes it very hard to even know what different crop might do better."
LIES !!!!!!!
"The whole "" climate change "" scam has been proven to be extrapolated, misrepresented and completely fabricated. Fact."
"IMO ... There is a real problem with allof this. Our species may be able to create some difference in how much climate changes ... But climate on the planet has always changed ... What we must do is plan how we survive in the differing climate we are facing.

Because this affects the poor first, nothing happens."
Looks like Imperialists in dire need of your money. It is time to create a new fear mongering scenario to tax people.
We cannot stop it... As of human behavior is
One way or another we are all gonna die. We all already know how the story ends.
You poured huge volumes of methane into sea and air from Nord Stream pipelines
You know what's really deadly? The coming nuclear world war that our so-called great leaders are throwing us into! That worries me more than slightly higher temperatures! Nuclear war means the end of humanity and that will happen faster than a bunch of climate fearmongers
"I live on a lake in Minnesota, USA.  The ice averages going out April 20, but this year was March 4.  This is the first time in history that we couldn't drive our trucks on the ice to put out our fish houses.  Tipping point?"
finally we can stop talking about 1.5 can´t hear it anymore
"The simplest physics to understand is that ice that melts will continue to melt until it gets colder. The earth will not get colder for several thousand years, no matter how fast we reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. As long as the permafrost thaws, new greenhouse gases will continue to be added to the atmosphere. The world will get warmer. Physical fact."
We’ve known what we are doing and countries have done little to change and continually give false obligations at Summits as they don’t in-act policies and changes to meet the targets. Just false commitments to look good.
For like the last 8 El Niños each has been worse than the last.
I’m a simpleton. I see it. The sun is hotter as well.
I lost my house and have been living in my car for 5 years now...last night was so cold I thought I was going to die...somehow I'm no longer the right person to talk to when it comes to global warming...😖
"talk about stuff you know about , this is off the wall  we know better"
Unfortunately your thermometers where not accurate 1970'S it was 1. 5 degrees off 1960's 2 to 3 degrees  and 1950's your 5 degrees  higher than it actually was .This is do to ignorance and not reading the proper DATA. Alberta CANADA. - 40 DEGREES THIS WINTER!!!!!!!.

"No one really understands this 1.5 degree measurement. It’s meaningless in the everyday world where the temperature range that is experienced daily varies constantly by more than this. Most automatically think “oh it’s going to be 1.5 degrees warmer” and don’t really comprehend it. So the poles are going to be -23.5c instead of -25c, USA average will be 13.5c instead of 12c. There needs to be an advertising campaign that visually shows what this actually means. Not what it could or might do - something that explains what this 1.5 degree statistic really is."
Too much bomb being drop to the earth. Stop war and stop producing arm and bombs. Is it difficult to comprehend?
"Heck, here February is going to be 10 degrees warmer than normal including the last week forecast temperatures. The first time ever recorded the average temp will be above freezing!"
Put the sun shades up
What a crock! 🤣😂🤣😂
I do wonder how the Romans survived when it was 4.3 degrees warmer than it is now. They MUST have melted! 😜🤣
And a large volcanic eruption will change everything in a few weeks. Climate change is a social construct
"Media Nonsense. As recent as 70’s we were told an ice age is coming. Then the same people in 80’s threaten us oil would be run out in 20 years.  When both hoaxes failed, they start to scare us by global warming nonsense."
"better cut back the animal agriculture  and stop the massive greed of consuming animals( The COW that is never discussed).  It is a huge problem with land degradation, rain forest destruction, and exuberant amounts of gas into the atmosphere.  Animal AG currently using more land than humans themselves."

The emissions of climate-damaging gases and the like will not stop. on the contrary! In the near future it will even increase. Stop letting politicians lie to you!
Did anybody here hear about the volcano that erupted underwater in Tonga
"You have to focus on production not consumption. If it is dug up and processed it will be burnt. Norway can boast all they want but at the end of the day they are causing global warming much more than other nations. It is within Norway's power to leave it in the ground. Renewables are energy solutions not global warming solutions. The only solution to global warming is to leave fossil fuels in the ground. If you dig up sequestered carbon(coal, oil, natural gas)then you are the problem.
You can't blame consumers for using the energy that is available to them. 
That is not how we dealt with the O-zone layer issue. What we did do is ban most production and sale of CFCs."
If west Stops eating beef then climate will automatically recover. Stop lecturing poor countries
Climate change and rising sea levels will make properties in coastal areas impossible to insure. Banks will be reluctant to give a mortgage for 15 or 30 years because the property may be under water.  Selling properties to average buyers will become impossible in the future as banks and mortgage companies stop making loans for these properties. Florida is a high risk state  for insurance and extreme weather like hurricanes. People will have to self insure and take the risk of loss. Condo associations are losing their insurance and if they find a new higher cost policy they will be passing on the higher costs to association members. Flooded cars from Florida hurricanes were filling the salvage lots. Insurance companies will raise rates and pass on the costs and risks to policy holders next year.
"Climate change is not what you screws need to be watching for. Hot or Cold ,fresh water is the planet killer."

"Co2 is 0.04% of the atmosphere, and is If the Earth's temperature were to rise by 1.4°C over the next 100 years, that would be an average increase of 0.014°C per year...

So each year they want to waste billions and reduce all living standar to reduce the average temp with 0.014°C by fighting a weak gass that is 0.04% of the atmosphere... And that gass would not even rise the climate with 0.014°C if it was 0.08 of the atmosphere even..."

"Nature can be wonderful if we treated fair. Nature is left with the task of trying to cool this small planet With all the floods that have been happening across the world . If you want to do something stop by not using your cars And  not using plastics.. The ice is melting. Evaporation of freshwater is increasing. The air is polluted. Every economy in the world is running on and operating with fossil fuels. Everyone in this world is using fossil fuels what can this small planet expect from us in the future. Governments started this. ,.by damning all the rivers And stopping the natural cycle. Spending money foolishly not practicing birth control in a serious way and depending on fossil fuels for their economy.What can I say thank you for your video it may promote urgency."
We need to stop global warming alarmism
"No matter what, everything in the universe wants to be at a relaxed state of equilibrium. But because the earth spins and rotates around the sun we see strange weather patterns and try to call it global warming to push a monetary movement."
Get geothermal and trees to moderate temperatures instead of aircons which exacerbates the problem
Love how it’s “we have to get used to this somehow” instead of “we have to finally make meaningful changes to our industrial lifestyles.”
Why didn't the researcher warned the global leaders to stop the wars and focus more on the global warming ?
we are doomed
"""And we just have to get used to it"" no we don't. We need to reform and punish the companies and governments who have been allowing it to continue to get worse. Scientists have been warning governments and companies what happens if they continue to what they do. The governments/companies have known the consequences of their actions and continued to do what they do regardless. Sure climate change is happening all around us. But we need to punish those who have let it get this far(so far)"
Bla bla bla every summer is hot so stip witj this lies
We need to do everything we can to reduce CO2. We cannot go over 2 degrees more. This is already too difficult.
But yall say climate change and weather are two different things. Whats the convenient truth?

In South Africa the highest temperature in ver recorded was 42 degrees C. Europe is now getting hotter than South Africa.
"Actually proud of the European nations. At least they are figuring out ways to remain cool without blasting air conditioners. I don’t think people realize that air conditioners are one of the MVPs of greenhouse, gas emissions.  To cool the room you’re in you’re basically blowing hot air into the environment."

"The sun’s light bestows life upon our planet — then, as the warmth of the Earth radiates outward, it is held onto for a bit longer by greenhouse gases. If this heat escaped too freely, our planet would be frozen solid; but, if the radiant heat is held onto for too long, then the opposite occurs."

Otherwise, above 40C is quite normal in many parts of the world and houses are adapted to deal with that temperature.
2nd Climate change is no doubt a reality. People talk a lot about it but leave it to the governments to take action. While doing nothing themselves. At least one can plant a tree where ever one owns a free plot of land or space and take care of it. Its a very simple and cost effective way to improve the situation."

No it is not. If you look at history it has happ many times before. The Sahara is not far away and its midsummer.

"42°C IN ROME IN JULY 1841:
BEFORE CARS & PLANES:
UNRELATED TO CO2:
The maximum official temperature ever recorded by any weather station in Rome Italy, was 42°C on the 27th July 1841. A cursory internet search shows temperature reaching 40°C every other Summer. Therefore another 42°C is certainly not unprecedented, and since the last was in 1841 it does  not equate with any gradual increase in the last few years. It would instead indicate the peak of warming was reached there in 1841. Long before everyone drove cars or flew in airplanes. How does this fit into the scaremongering? It does not."
You western peoples are responsible for this disaster💔
"don't dare anyone make a move... just stay nice and still and let this continue to happen, shhhhh forget about what those scientists have been saying since even the 1900s... what do they know?! they were just trying to make a name for themselves, get a nobel prize or something and get rich right? That's what my Dad always said. So he's gotta be right, he seemed pretty damn certain! You know it's all those scientists cared about, silly snake oil salesman scientists! Don't listen to them, instead we just gotta keep listening to Government and big money making industries... i mean who else would have your back?? and who else would want to treat you so kindly and cheer for your good health? and above all, your prosperity? no one, just big brother! Definitely not those evil scientists types... pshhh!!! forgedabout it. Just keep grinding every day, let's all enjoy this warm weather, who needs the cold?"

"actualy, blameing the climates changes on our activities is just another form of human arrogance, in believeing that we are god-like beings, with total control over our planet, but, bear this in mind. hundreds of millions of years ago, the earth was coverd by water. fish were the dominant species. then, the climate changed, there was smaller oceans & more land, it was warm & humid, with forrests of ferns & horsetails. amphibians evolved. then the climate changed dramatialy ,turning the lands into hot, dry deserts. reptiles evolved. then, it turned warm & humid, forrests & swamps returned, huge dinosaurs developed, then the climate got dryer & cooler, armourd dinosaurs evoled, then some sort of catastrophy wiped out the dinosaurs & mammals evolved. from them, evolved the human race, then the climate changed yet again, & there was an ice age. finaly, the climate changed again, & became as it is today. so,now, think how many times the climate has changed over all those hundreds of millions of years, when there were no humans, no civilization, no polution. now, the climate is changeing, yet again, & we stupidly believe that it wouldn't happen, if it wasent for our steam engines, factories etc, but, time & time again, it happend in the distant past. its just time for the next change, & it would happen ,even if we were still monkeys swinging in the trees!"

"Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Aerosols -  Effects of Large Increases on Global Climate 

Abstract.

Effects on the global temperature of large increases in carbon dioxide and aerosol densities in the atmosphere of Earth have been computed. 

It is found that, although the addition of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere does increase the surface temperature, the rate of temperature increase diminishes with increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 

For aerosols, however, the net effect of increase in density is to reduce the surface temperature of Earth. 
Because of the exponential dependence of the backscattering, the rate of temperature decrease is augmented with increasing aerosol content. 

An increase by only a factor of 4 in global aerosol background concentration may be sufficient to reduce the surface temperature by as much as 3.5°K.

If sustained over a period of several years, such a temperature decrease over the whole globe is believed to be sufficient to trigger an ice age.

"It is confirmed India experimenting with cloud seeding prevented the monsoon rains from reaching Australia leading to the largest Bushfires ever experienced by Australia.
As soon as Covid hit India ceased experimenting and finally the long extended drought started to break.
Now we are experiencing excessive rainfall as the weather system readjusts.
This is what was predicted the conditions that Australia experienced will be experienced by every country around the world until the weather system rebalances.
Stop cloud seeding now."

You propagandists are not telling the truth.
"Man made global warming is a theory. Why is the so called science being put forth not allowed to be questioned?That is not how science works. Why are all the studies being funded only allowed to reinforce this theory? Who is benefitting from this? Fear is being used to fool and control people. The earth has been warming for over 10,000 years. Oceans have risen over 300 meters in that time. Natural co2 vastly outweighs any human made amounts. CO2 makes up only .004% of the atmosphere. Ice cores show dramatic shifts in earths temperature throughout history without humans involved. These are very real, but inconvenient facts that must be understood. Question everything."
Scaremongers!
Hottest year on record? You mean since we started setting up thermometer stations not even 200 years ago? Or do you mean the satellite record that dates back only 40 years? You understand the planet is 4.5 billion years old right?
"Was a good high school math teacher when CCSS dropped. We saw a blip, but teachers forced to be instructors of the Federal Given Wisdom failed.

Stop geoengineering it's destroying our ozone.
Unfortunately the source of this report is not credible. Climate change has been politicized to the point where it is no longer science. How can they separate the effects of the El Nino from what they call anthropomorphic climate change? They cannot. Nor can they draw any conclusions from short term trends.
The environment has been changing for millions of years before fossil fuels were used. I'm tired of these lies that we can stop climate change. How about clean up all the plastic in oceans? That will clean the planet.
"This is very funny, they don't believe you."
You have records since 1800’s and that “scientist” talks about thousand years. So we take 200 years and extrapolate to 1000 that’s real “science”
The most accurate indicator of earths temp is the arctic tree line when the earth warmed in the roman and medievel warm period it moved north 100km it is currently stable which means the earth is not warming

"Sono le industrie e le aziende di tutto il mondo che restano attive 24h su 24 e non si fermano mai che provocano l'aumento delle temperature e il surriscaldamento del pianeta
Per abbattere i costi e far aumentare i profitti sui articoli che essi vendono li fanno viaggiare in giro per il mondo
e dopo che questi prodotti sono stati assemblati in 5 paesi diversi e magari e magari altrettanti impianti di assemblaggio solo a quel punto il prodotto viene venduto a un prezzo molto maggiore rispetto a quello che sarebbe se l'impianto di produzione e assemblamento avesse luogo nello stesso luogo

Si chiama Profitto
È in nome di questo dio che tutti su questo pianeta stanno devastando foreste e depauperando ogni suolo sia con l'allevamento intensivo sia con l'agricoltura intensiva

Hanno proibito di utilizzare le armi atomiche non perché era un'arma troppo brutale
Ma soltanto perché questo avrebbe tolto lustro e prestigio a chi manda a morire dei invasati per difendere interessi personali di altri individui 

Questo è stato deciso all'unisono dall'assemblea di tutti i capi militari di tutto il pianeta e anche da tutte le varie gilde e gruppi militari

Il fanatismo industriale e l'era della produzione di massa gestita e controllata da un ristrettissimo gruppo di persone 
Sta lasciando segni indelebili sul pianeta e anche nelle comunità
Questi individui Sono anche responsabili del peggioramento e dell'impoverimento dello stile e della qualità di vita di tutta la classe che interessa il settore della produzine a livello mondiale

e obblighi militareschi da dover accettare per forza a ogni costo 
per garantire l'egemonia e il strapotere che sono concentrati nelle mani di pochi individui e pochissime famiglie

Non esistono scuse né tanto meno giustificazioni valide per quello che i leader del mondo stanno facendo 
Né tanto meno per quello che dovrebbero fare 

Io questo gioco non lo tollero più 
La sete di potere e dominio ha offuscato la mente e lo spirito sia da dentro che da fuori

"Do not be a Greta. The sky is not falling. You will be okay ! More plausible to the conjecture of Human Induced Climate Change causing this years and the next Summers global heat spikes is  the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai volcanic eruption that was so powerful that it threw ocean salt water, and all the chemicals contained in that salty water to make it salty, high up into Earth's Stratosphere, with sea water's elements & salt minerals lofted high up now further energized by the approaching July 2025 Solar Maximum, moisture to circle the globe resulting in warming the Earth, both changing weather patterns, or severity, or both. Please read the resulting observed facts, not conjecture, presented about this undersea supervolcano's eruption offered by NASA/ JPL (remember this is a U.S. Federal Government Agency).........""The underwater eruption in the South Pacific Ocean also blasted an enormous plume of water vapor into Earth's stratosphere – enough to fill more than 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. The sheer amount of water vapor could be enough to temporarily affect Earth's global average temperature""..... Please Google what has been stated by NASA/ JPL learned scientists with many degrees, and atmospheric climate expertise on Aug 2, 2022, but not mentioned by the much less educated YouTuber profiteering talking head types seeking, click bait doom porn offering green's spewing a porn agenda for personal enrichment using social media to contribute to the tale of emanate climate catastrophe and resulting doom to collect funds to fund a personal paycheck or organizations funding or grow the influence of their cause. Please do not fall prey, and make yourself mentally ill as is the plight of many holding a smartphone incessantly worrying about climate change as if humans can somehow change Earth's naturally evolving Climate Change outcome. Tonga is the most likely reason why we have higher temps this Summer, and for maybe two more. Not the overly touted ,only answer, human induced global warming spike. What is happening is Earth's 4.5 billion years of ongoing natural climate change, that is all as we come out of this ongoing ice age, Earth is just evolving to a warmer period, as has happened in the past many cycles ago. You are born now and that is the Global Climate you will endure as a result of what happened with yet another SuperVolcano Eruption. Good thing it was water not dust thrown into the Stratosphere, because we would have a major global cooling for us all to be chivering through during the Winter months. For your better mental health, please focus on something uplifting and positive during your very short life cycle, not climate catastrophe doom porn. Do not be a Greta. The sky is not falling. You, and generations to come will be okay for the 60 to 80 year life cycle years you and, them will be walking on Earth's surface unless Earth and the Universe has another plan we have no control over !"

"Yes, climate change is causing weather around the world but not for reasons uninformed climate activist think. Climate has been changing on this planet for 4.6 billion years!!!

well by enclosing all occeans possible you get perfect cilmate cotroll up to now we have only gibralta
"Oh yeah, you know what would help? More taxes and nuclear power plants shut down. That should do it!"
The problem is the speed of the change right now. If you see the Milankovitch cycle you will see that the temperature change past 70 years usually happens in a matter of a few thousand years naturally. The real problem is that many species including humans don't have time to adapt to the change and they should change habitat or just go extinct.

Europe deserves these
"The Russians are working hard to help cure global warming. So far they have killed hundreds of thousands of people that otherwise would have cut down trees and burned fossil fuels. They have also completely leveled quite a few cities, helping with drainage problems and eliminating hard surfaces that shed water rather than allowing it to absorb into the ground.
More work along these lines is clearly necessary. If we could eliminate only 70% of the people and tear down and replant with trees 70% of our cities, in about 300 million years there will be little evidence of global warming."
These claims cannot be substantiated; all these weather events show either total stationarity over time or moderate downward trends in spite of much more carbon dioxide in the air as a component of the atmosphere's composition.
It may be caused by a natural cycle of the Earth and / or the Sun (?)
What caused the Great Storm of 1703?
Uhm Yes? What is driving the stupidity of ignoring it
You folks must actually believe that the world is only 50 years old.

- building more and more *coal-fired power plants,* and 
- burning more and more *fossil fuel.*"

stop infantilizing people! everyone already knows what's going on!! it is clear who are the ones to be blamed: politicians and lobbies!! and the solution is very simple: STOP emitions!!!
Wars too caused climate change.
What is up with the English teeth? I couldn’t even listen to the report.
In Ireland weather is 100% normal or so it seems looking out the windows of the pubs all the time :)
Seems to me that running after peace might be the easiest way for us human beings to begin staying ahead of climate change well enough to next help us with the extra time and resources needed for research on how ndustries can be running with less production of CO2 emissions for real instead of only expecting women of child bearing age to have only up to 2 children each. Seems to me that no longer conscripting young people into the military as often to work on things like energy sucking tanks and energy sucking rocket launchers and to worlkon more humongous enegy sucking nuclear submarines too would be the better bare minimum effort to avert major global catastrophic natural diasters being brought on by ourselves rather than for example offering things like free sterilization procedures to young people while blaming climate change only on expanding economies and on increasing populations in wide open spaces.

So many vaccinated people in the comments.
"I have to reply to one statement made here: I doubt very much 'the world' is watching Europe's weather very attentively, since most other countries in the world are having climate issues of their own!

In Scotland, we had a very unusual 12 week dry period in the Spring/Early Summer, with temps touching 32 Celsius locally (that's the 2nd year in a row now. Unheard of previously). Other than that, the weather has been fairly okay. I'm glad I'm no longer living in England, I could not tolerate temperatures of up to 40 Celsius. 

I've noticed species from Southern English counties are moving up here, including blue and Painted Lady butterflies, Nightingales, and dragonfly species that should be dwelling in more southerly latitudes."
"Some* ""Experts"" (whatever that is) claim.

False narrative to say ""experts claim"" as it sounds like all agree which they do not.

I'm also an expert."
"What causes climate change ? Stretch the truth, bury common sense, flat out lie !"
"We had a record number of rain events this year in New Zealand. While the media boffins claimed climate change, the fact that approx 60 million cubic meters of water was thrown up in the atmosphere plus ash and other gases 2 years ago by the Tongan eruption has had no effect??? Yeah right!!"
5:13 argument based on conclusion (it is not supposed to be).
"That's the karma received by the Europeans that had burnt so much oil and gas since the industrial revolution. And they don't want to be responsible. They still want to keep the good life of driving cars, warming  and cooling the houses and  buildings. Flying thousands and thousands of airplanes."
"I found it interesting to make drawings, to show the situation, at least the children learn, but making drawings for reckless politicians is not going to stick, people have to stop voting for politicians who sell themselves to the oil industry, politicians who are deniers of changes weather."

All thanks to our western industrial age took all the resources from their colonies and left us with tones of carbons. Now they are asking developing nations to reduce carbon emissions.
If I understand correctly: only the US and China can ultimately turn global pollution levels around. It doesnt really matter how much greener the rest of the world gets at this stage of the crisis.
"It's all happened before.

 But 'before' no-one had a cell phone tablet or any confected interest, and the meda printed the facts. The worlds polulation was smaller, as was it's infastructure and therefore the damage that could be caused.

Get a life."
Whats with the climate change videos popping up all of the sudden?
IS CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSING CHANGES TO THE CLIMATE?!???!?!?!!!! HOW WILL WE EVER KNOW?
yeah we having some good cold ice rain / hail strom  in the tropical islands its a real proof climate change doesnt exist
"7:33. What? A crop failure is *always* a big, big problem, even if your crop are cactus. If your crop failed, you are in debt for seeds, fertilizer, pesticides (even if they are organic), other materials - work - and if the crop fails and you have nothing to sell - BIG PROBLEM."

"Of course it feels unusual if you are looking at events within our lifetime, look at it from a longer timeline perspective and you will soon find these events are completely normal."
More taxes should fix it I reckon
So the war is bad for the planet then?
a comment
consume less.
The weather is man-made...pull your head out of the sand!!!
"Europe had hottest month in August and July. Every year. 

Meanwhile in Prague and CZK we had coldest day in August and Coldest Month in July. 

Media always has an agenda."
"""Not our problem"" war burning nearby for 1.5 years. I wonder all these fires causing something or just coincidence?"
We need to continue talking about the hard moment of human history we are and take personal decitions and make resilient comunities based in degrowth. Im doing it.
Where are the climate change (extreme) deniers?
"Isn't it cute how obsessively she keeps pushing the narrative that burning fossil fuels is all there is to blame? It's not like the planet or sun have any cycles... nah it's humans burning too much coal because we're such hot sh... stuff, and no one can tell us otherwise and destroy our delusion of grandeur!"
Yesh
"It has been the coldest summer in my life of 42 years in Detroit, Michigan and the entire Great Lakes region. It has also been one of the coolest summers in the British aisles and northern Europe. No explanation of how global warming can cause entire regions to be unseasonably cold during the hottest time of the year for months on end. In fact they don't even report it. But three hot days will be called climate change and reported on every news episode every time."
Crazy weather and climate driven by their own crazy people 😁
"Maybe it is just God, reacting to the evil and woke of europe"
There is no such thing as CC‼️
"It's such a weird subject when you consider some countries and islands have fighting against it since the 80s and 90s and nothing has changed on any fronts. Whether it's Herbs and French Letter or Midnight Oils Beds are burning, we've known it all for a very long time."
"Creationism must be educated OUT of America or we will never find the political will, as a country, to address this problem.
Ironically, the death cult may just manage to fulfill its own ancient fairy tales’ “prophecy”."
I’d rather the end of the world than Jim Crow vaccine passports
"Wherever in the world early homo sapiens arrived, the megafauna were wiped out really quickly. I think that is a sign that our species is probably a kind of ""lethal mutation""."
Just cut off their heads
"Let be clear anyone that denied science about the climate change, with the covid vaccine and any science relate, just stop wasting your time with these people you wont change their mind because they don't care!! they only care about themself, power and money that it. What we should do right now is to end the fossil fuel company, no more gas car, stop cutting tree and planting tree.If they complaint about those thing so be it!, let them cry they just annoying just ignore them!!"
The only massive undertaking that would actually do something.  Would be a mass die-off of Boomers and rich elites and politicians.   Democrats can sit around and sing all they want to try to get change.  Buts it's no different than the Religious idea of Sending Thoughts and Prayers.   Actions would need to require violence and extremes to get change done.   But Democrats do not have the stomach for it.
No one will look back on this time by 2100.
It’s way worse than IPCC says. Watch climate scientist Paul Beckwith’s YT channel.
"Just remember who is fighting this, make them pay."
It’s like my buddy Corey use to say in high school “ dude we’ve got some great dope so let’s stay as high as we can for as long as we can” all we have to gain by adhering to these environmental and public health protocols is a couple more generations of eating bugs and living in a pod. Because even if we be real real careful and do as were told we’re still gone a die one day and so will the earth eventually.
"So .. are those responsible, those that stood against the idea of climate change - who were in power - be punished for it? if not .. its all just talking .. and the very same people will keep doing it."
There is speculation that as the ice melts large amounts of trapped greenhouse gasses will escape into the atmosphere.  Like lots and lots of methane and co2.  We're going to be cozy.  BTW  that is one of the few charts that gives an accurate picture of situation.  Always be care to check the units and labels.  Charts are almost always manipulated to exaggerate a point.  This one is not.
Darwin's theory of evolution isn't about the strongest or most intelligent that will survive but those most able to adapt collectively to a common threat.

it's Al Gore on the scissor lift all over again - runaway thermal overload extinction event all stop
"And aint nothing we can do about it. Sorry electric cars wont fix it. Too many people, and not enough resources. The earth started empty, and that is where it will start again. Empty of life"
Can you talk about line 3 & 5 please!!!! Our water and land is in danger.
If we go extinct there won't be anyone to look back on this time in history.
"This is why I look for climate action in politics. While I understand disagreement, a border wall can’t block hurricanes, and is limited in abilities to block floodwater. How can we secure our borders if the planet is burning?"
Why haven't we murdered the people responsible for the destruction of our species?
"None of this is surprising, it's expected, but very depressing. I really hope we can do something cuz I doubt we have much time left"
The billionaires are trying to escape the planet because they know they screwed everything up beyond all remedy and what they and their companies set in motion will cause Earth to shake humanity off like fleas
"Governments know only one way to fix global warming.

Through war famine and genocide."
In order to make a change happen means convincing the rich that the earth is the only thing worthy of worship.
"THANK YOU FOR EDUCATING PEOPLE ON THIS ISSUE OVER AND OVER EVEN IN VIDEOS ABOUT OTHER SUBJECTS, WHERE ITS RELEVANT. GREATLY APPRECIATE YOU ALL!  Also a question, how do we fight and change tax laws in our state keeping poor very poor. 60k a year puts you in a tax bracket with billionaires. I would love to learn what I can do to help change that. Know you have a lot to cover, so ty either way."
"Humanity doesn't deserve planet Earth. We were given a beautifully bio-diverse paradise. The only paradise in existence as far as we can see, and what did we do with it? Squandered it all for short-term gain! Frankly, if aliens would swoop in to kill us all and become the new caretakers of the planet, I'd say please and thank you. No offense."
"The lobbyists, corporate executives and Republicans don't believe climate change is a problem or issue they think it's a problem for the future, yet some of them busy building and stocking bunkers, because they believe that is all they will need to survive. But I got some questions if the rest of the world ends and you survive who will value your money? Who will repair the world for you to live in? Can you honestly say you will have enough resources to survive a terrible situation like the end of the world when you done know how long it will last or how bad it will be, but keep banking your money and raping the world to make more money"
"We're only 4 or 5 months away from some Dumb ass congress person walking in with a snowball asking ""I thought there's global warming"""
"we need immediate action to stem the worst effects - thankfully you can always count on human cooperation to do the right thing in the shortest time period.  no problemo.  we got this.  it's all good.........................shite, is that MY house on fire ?!"
"Prosperous state in America is California???
....
Are you freaking kidding me. Then why do they need so much Federal Assistance or subsidizing.... what planet are you guys living on?"
Money wont matter when the world in gone
mother earth has had enough
I'll have to consider buying a home with 3 or 4 stories in it... and I don't mean above ground... is this how we evolve into mole people?  Escape the hot atmosphere by building civilizations underground? xD Lol.
The IPCC is not a group of scientists.   They are a political body.  Fossil fuels have done more to make the world a better and safer place for people than any other thing in the history of mankind.  If you are too stupid to see that....you're a moron.
Were all screwed the planet is on fire there is a pandemic Aaron's and disease ravage in the world
"Man. bear, pig is real."
Call your representative and demand climate action. Green new deal today or venus atmosphere tomorrow!
going vegan is the best thing YOU can do to combat climate change look it up
Tippingpoints. People think it's bad now? Wait till it accelerates.
"Why do they always show Nuclear Power Plant cooling towers as a picture for climate change and destruction of the environment?  Yes, nuclear power is not perfect, but our world would be so much more screwed without them.  Nuclear is about 10% of the worlds power generation.  It would be replaced primarily with gas and coal."
I agree Mr. Brown...like the last name by the way.
"I live in an rv with 5 250 watt solar panels on the roof. 100% of my electricity comes from solar no air conditioning no shower no toilet 100% of my trash is self contained. Using a technology a good friends working on called the waste-bot Id be willing to bet thousands of dollars that my carbon footprint in comparison to yours is dwarfed by the emissions you cause and not counting whatever bogus tax deductible Donations you rich people do to feel better about yourselves. Im just talking the ecological effects of my lifestyle vs yours. So its not just ""a few jobs in ohio"" what happens to the more than 1 million Americans who live in rv's full time and the estimated 1 in 500 Americans just living in normal cars. And id bet the number of people living in truck/trailer combos is pretty high as well if you get rid of fossil fuels you instantly displace around 2 million Americans living in vehicles. I also live in a rural town no city bus (buses use fossil fuels anyway so yet another hole in your logic) no train no subway. Most people around here commute to the city or other places for work are they expected to quit their job after not being able to walk 30 miles to work. Whats the solution here. According to ABC News, the average American drives 16 miles to work each way. That distance is not realistically walk-able or bike-able. I suppose in your mind we all get to go out and buy teslas and cybertrucks it must be fun to be so rich your solution to climate change involves nearly every United states citizen losing their job and becoming homeless lol get a grip"
"It seems like its the republican job to start wildfire in California. 1 dude was caught starting 6 of them last month. if they're not stating them on purpose, they start them with Gender revealing parties that get out of control."
& the boomers rebuild & it happens again
If these billionaires don’t give AF about their future generations why do you think they would care about yours ?? Living it up for today 🤷🏾‍♀️

Omg SpaceX will have to launch solar shades across the earth!
Can anyone answer me this question If we suck the life out of the world and burn it. IE gas coal oil  etc that took millions of year's to form and if we are burning up the earth can it make the world lighter and draw us nearer to the sun by a mere centimetre or does gravity hold us in place regardless
Dam right politicians didn't listen now they have to. They are killing us
"Wait, China actually is putting a lot of effort to transform into renewable energy, though either if it is fast enough is a different matter."

"I gave up on humanity last year while I was evacuated from my home for over a month during the CZU Lightning Complex fire, and I was camped with tons of other evacuees that were climate change deniers.

"The highest temperature ever reliably recorded: 130 degrees F was observed two years in a row in Death Valley, August 2020 and July 2021.  Can't be a coincidence."
"We are screwed, screwed."
"That last chart looks a lot like the income inequality chart, I wonder if there is a correlation..."
"I'm so scared. I'm so scared. I'm so scared. I can't do this anymore. How far is money going to get people if we are all dead? Like seriously? What's it going to hurt to just protect ourselves? Even if they don't believe in climate change, what's it going to hurt to just say ""hey just in case maybe we should do something""? I don't understand any of this. Between the pandemic and now this I think I'm slowly losing my mind. I have really bad anxiety and it's been set off so much in the past few years and I feel so powerless to do anything. I'm so so so scared. I'm just so thankful I can't have kids. I couldn't even imagine having a child right now. I just wish I didn't have to suffer through all of this myself. And just the other day I was admiring some of the things humans have been doing in other fields of creativity and technology think ""this is such an interesting time to be alive to see all of this"". Too bad that's not going to last thanks to money-hungry idiots who only care about themselves. I just want humanity to live in peace for once in its existence! But we always have to make things harder on ourselves ..."
We can blame those who were opposed to the Paris Climate Accord and backed us out of it. That is eco-terrorism.
There is no country more stupid and antiquated in the world than the United States 🇺🇸 🤦🏼‍♂️
"Seems you're really not getting it.  We have a choice.  Grow up, or die.  But yeah, keep looking to capitalism and political parties.  I'm sure they'll totally do the right thing any day now..."
If we mandated plant base nutrition instead of vaccines we could naturally immune ourselves to Covid and reduce and slow down climate change!  The US is not really trying to solve these 2 devastating issues their focus is to  continue to divide its  people and the world!!!
We're going to start seeing more diseases. One of them is called trump lickers.
"No surprise, MOST PEOPLE on this once gorgeous world have helped MAKE this problem & not nearly enough care to help repair the damage...."
"China where every plague was born, should have never been let into our system, a big thank you to Richard Nixon on that one. If this problem is so severe how come all these wells have been left unplugged for as long as 100 years? Read this.  ""More than 100 years of drilling have left 3 million abandoned oil and gas wells across the United States, and more than 2 million of them are “unplugged” according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency"". These wells are spewing methane into the atmosphere for decades and no one noticed or thought it was important? But now we have to drive electric cars? Let me be perfectly clear here, the U.S. can help but China is where the real problems lie. It's one thing that China is destroying their own environment, it's another thing destroying the planet. Historically weather has been dynamic and all these so-called experts think it is static, and it is not. TheReaper!"
Socialism never got the energy it deserved (pun intended). I wonder if these brilliant individuals in “power”  are all ready to fly to the moon so they can begin destroying that too.
"Unless this is reversed, nothing else really matters very much, over the long term. Every report over the last 30+ years has been worse than the previous. It's insane that it's a partisan ""issue"" in the US. The only issue is the survival of humanity and the planet. (Actually, Cenk, the planet's biosphere might not be fine with a drastically altered atmosphere.) Problem is that this can't be done under capitalism due to structural competitive incentives, unless it can possibly be HIGHLY regulated by governments."
Global leaders can't do shit ... Because their oil daddy's won't let them
"Republicans do believe the science climate change. They KNOW global warming is a real thing. 
They want it to happen. When the Arctic shelf melts away they can get to the oil that’s beneath it.  
(Why they’re not concerned with methane gas, is a mystery.)
Further, as the Arctic melts away, more water vapor (a green house gas), will further increase the global temperature.  So methane gas isn’t the only danger."
"At this point, politicians and companies need to be force to take climate change seriously and understand the consequences. Republicans and democrats need to shut their mouths and listen to the scientists. Dealing with the effects of climate change is more important right now."
I blame capitalism
"Good to see TYT talking about this. One aspect of Human behavior I did not hear was population. At 7.8 billion people, just the heat produced for survival is huge. Measure that. Then when done spending those tax dollars, just to be ignored, do a study on the Deep ocean oxygen sequestration feedback loop. If Oxygen is sequstered, what will the 7.8 billion breath?"
How about we start the process of reckoning with climate change by putting fossil fuel executives on trial for crimes against humanity?
"Since many of them don´t believe in the existance of a virulent disease either i guess the severity of that problem is ""shrinking"". Cynical but that´s where Broken States ""politics"" went for a while... don´t know whether this has reached the point of ""no return"" too."
can't even comprehend the hubris of a committee deciding on what amount of terraforming is acceptable
Humans are too self centered to change  The planets doing for us what we can't do for ourselves
Russia benefits from the climate change. Russia have huge areas that are currently too cold but will be habitable when the earth becomes warmer.
"27% of carbon emissions come from China, 11% comes from USA, and China is building more coal fire power plants. The un report is already obsolete.  The data was taken over the last few years, not this year. Its very much worse now."
"Hypocrisy. If you eat meat, your diet is contributing to the climate catastrophe more than your car ever will. I'm tired of ""progressives"" blaming and focusing on oil companies. They are a big part of the problem, but if you truly care, simply change your diet. Can't give up steaks? Then how can you expect oil companies to give up profits. The UN has stated that the biggest positive impact that an individual can make is to switch to a vegan diet. This isn't even mentioned in reports like this. Come on Cenk. Admit that your diet is killing the planet that you claim to want to save. Use your podium to bring about real solutions."
Yawn. Winters are warmer. Good.
"If there's intelligent life somewhere
in universe, it sure as hell isn't to be found on planet Earth.
Greed, religion, two (2) world wars, communism, fascism,
nazism.... Earth, a planet full of bad, deadly, ideas."
Looks like h*ll on earth to me.
"The planet will shake us off like bad case of fleas, a surface nuisance.
~George Carlin"
They were talking about this on The Damage Report last week. A lot of car companies are promising to switch over to electric vehicles and I can't imagine many Trumpers being happy about that. They probably don't like the thought of driving an all electric Ford F-150. They love their diesel trucks and love rolling coal. Watching the planet burn is of no concern to them.
This is what happens when selfishness and greed among nations refuse to work together to make the world a better place.
Hindsight is 20/20. Who could have guessed that doing nothing wouldn’t work?
How does Ana know climate change isn't a lie propagated by woke activists? she should probably see what Jesse Singal has to say about it
Why not say f****** instead of GD no sense in using God's name in vain to get your point across
We all will be Black in the future. Racism solved.
"When ""Climate Change"" is pushed by politicans like the below average IQ bartender playing climate expert scientist scamming people with a movie documentary you know it's scam.
When ""Climate Change"" is marketed by a 16 yo ""How Dare you"",  you know it's backed by a group of crooks behind the scene for the purpose of manipulation and control to their advange."
None of these climate claims are accurate all the inner planets are increasing at the same rate we have a very in expensive solution a 100million dollar solar shade will counteract the abnormal sun activity
what if GOD was Earth (one of us 🌎🌍🌏) and we killed GOD (Earth)🦖👏😂🙃
I think it’s too late for humans we effed this planet up and are ignorant to what is going on around us.
"""The next time it will not be water, it will be fire"". Where have i heard/ read that🤔 man will cause their  own demise/end. Don't 😢 now, we all allow these incompetent dunbazz to lead us into ""hell on earth"""
"Rainfall does not equal snowfall. 5 inches of rain in an hour is not 5 feet of snow in an hour, snow falls slower than rain. It may be 1 foot of snow in an hour, but 5 feet is ridiculous and Cenk should know better than to make such a spurious claim."
"Pretty much all nuclear power was developed in the 60s. There's much better nuclear options now, but it's a matter of actually being able to use them."
Nuclear is the dirtiest coal is the most pollution for air
Give up any hope. We are toast 😂
There is tide energy and many other alternatives. Nuclear energy had accidents that last thousands of years to recover.
Saw pics from back home. Bear mountain bridge was blocked by a rock slide.
Keep laughing Republicans. I'm living on prime ocean front property here in Missouri.
Thank fellows like the koch bros who propagandize to sell more oil so as to make more money never mind they could not possibly spend what they have in ten life times……..these folks need to be held accountable

Obama built his fossil fueled mansion at sea level on Martha’s Vineyard Island.  Guess he’s not agreeing with the narrative.
Wooooo
Conservatives don't wanna believe it because that means their whole way of life has to change and this entire system has to change and they don't wanna do that..
"America can't do it alone either, If we can't get China on board to cut emissions we will be in trouble. It's not enough to say we'll cut emissions by 2030 but put in coal plants every year until 2029, It's not enough to wait for an imaginary 2030 deadline because the time for action is NOW!"
have guy mcpherson on!!!!
Yet political discourse & fights trigger more views than this. We ought to be ashamed. Don't claim you care for your children if you don't care about this.
"This climate crisis is the result of an estimated 90 million barrels of oil going into the earth's atmosphere every, single day. Censorship, the rise of Christian nationalism, and undermining trust in science has one intention: the continuation of the iron grip the fossil fuel industry has on OUR government."
Many of the world's most wealthy individuals are meeting now in Sun Valley UT but are there any scientists there?  Are they only discussing future profits? They should be talking about the state of the planet and how they could help
Flash floods are an annual event here in Las Vegas. 8 inches would put Clark County in Lake Mead. Good thing there's no climate changing going on.
"The short answer is no. 
Humans will not be able to survive."
9 degrees hotter in the ocean can kill literally ALL the marine life in the ocean.
We need to reverse course or we wouldn't be able to sustain mammalian life by 2135. Our grandchildren will not have an Earth anymore.

"The republicons DO believe in climate change, but in order to steal full control of this country they have to convince their voters the opposite.

They want to steal another $8 trillion to save themselves and THEIR families from climate change, like trump did in office.

AND WE TRULY ARE ABOUT TO ENDURE THE PLANETS 6TH MASS EXTINCTION EVENT END I'M NOT READY TO SEE THAT....WE HAD AMPLE TIME TO FIX THINGS FOR OURSELVES AND BE THE TRUE SHEPHERDS OF EARTH... BUT WE TOOK ADVANTAGE AND NOW WE WILL ALL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES AS A SPECIES. I'M SO DEPRESSED
When i was 12 years old i saw an Al Gore documentary in school predicting all this to happen.  Couldnt you say that capitalism is the reason why we do irreperable damage to our planet as the corporate greed knows no end?
Haha vote Democrat or else we’ll all die right? Nothing like politics of fear! How stupid do they think voters are?
"the politicians don't care because very few of them will be losing much time, they're all too old, very few young enough to really deal with the consequences of their actions in such a way that their debt is enough to inspire good actors. Become more militant."
"Climate and weather are not the same. Climate is a complex stable system that takes century's if not millennia to change. If a weather event falls outside of 1 standard deviation of the mean, then it's statically an outlier i.e., ""extreme weather"". So extreme weather CANNOT mathematically be the result of climate change."
"We’ve already passed the tipping point, dude. We’re screwed"
MOTHER EARTH IS PISSED?!
"For those who don't have the memory of a goldfish, we've had hotter summers in past years. These narrative fear mongering deep state minions just want to plant the seed of fear in all of us in hopes that we'll get scared enough to make irrational decisions, thus in the process give up our rights for false security. A real scientist will tell you that 90-95 percent of the earth's climate/temperature is dictated by the sun's intensity in a given year. Before humans walked the earth, co2 levels were 10x higher, as well as the temperature due to increased volcanic activity. Life didn't parish then, so why would it parish now? As a matter of fact, getting rid of co2 will eventually eliminate all life on earth because we are all carbon-based life forms. Research voskore (not sure if I spelled that correctly), ice samples, and see for yourselves."
"We are entering an ice age. Warming ocean temps preceded all ice ages. There's still snow in California ffs. It's not just the ""greenhouse effect"" its also more water in the atmosphere equals more snow over elevation. But that's all going to happen, we can't stop it now. We can stop poisoning everything and advance our societies to take care of each other, ourselves and the environments we live in. We could, we should...."
Use everythingi like people have been saying
"Wow, if only we'd been warned... by experts... for generations."
Nuclear winter will warm us up

It isn't reality unless Christians believe it's true. 😂
"When we get a big snowstorm and someone makes a joke about global warming, the climate alarmists say its weather, not climate. When we get a flood or really hot weather, those same people blame the climate and my SUV."
"Ive  noticed the fake news and CiA paid Journalists are now focusing on the heat Index rather than daily temps...Today is 95 in Florida. Nothing new here. its summer time. Yet the weather channell is saying real feal 105°. To spread fear. This is another phsyop like covid. Focus on the""Deaths"" ""Count all the deaths as covid"" Its the same thing. People Florida is hot its always been hot in the summer. Temps are still in the 90s not 100s like they say..."
Outlaw barbecue’s
"Forget the seventies, I would say since the fifties, maybe thirties climate change was going on under radar. I think of that one episode of Captain Planet about global heating. Guess the villains won in this timeline."
Bring in the Terminators
The industrial revolution has reduced the number of weather related death to historic lows. Crazy weather events happen everyday somewhere on the planet and ALWAYS have. The difference is media rams these events down your throat.
We definitely need to take climate change seriously! Lawmakers also need to change/eliminate insurance requirements for mortgages for those areas where insurance companies have gone away!
"Thorium Nuclear is a no brainier. We either do it now, or after we had our buts kicked enough to surrender.  Nuclear, to produce weapons, is not sustainable, as we are experiencing.  We also need to be able to mine for battery materials.  Most counties have material for both battery materials and thorium. The regulations to mine battery materials keeps the costs high, so those materials are mined in countries with relaxed environmental laws where it is cheaper to extract. 

It is time to stop doing things with profit  and defense as the only for motives. It is time to do things because those things are the correct things to do."

Go mother nature.  She has the ultimate design for ridding pests from her present and putting them in her past.  I think we'll be making the cut in her not so distant future🙂.
"3:05 Cenk, you cannot compare the water-equivalent of a snowstorm to a summerstorm. Air can hold a lot more moisture at higher temperatures, so it's much more likely to have high amounts of rainfall in the summer than in the winter. Such high amounts of snow would be even more impressive I would argue. Air of 80F can hold about 5 times the amount of water as air of 32F. That's why you see the highest amounts of precipitation during hurricanes. But yes, as tempertures rise, we will see more extreme rainfall events because of higher temperatures."
"Whether mankind induced or not, there should finally be a societal realization that we are in the midst of changing climatic times and so need to take steps to keep people safe.  It is doubtful that any steps can arrest or counterbalance what is happening here on Earth (as well as other planets in our solar system!).   

Where will all the environmental refugees go?  How will we feed people if farmland is flooded/parched/deep frozen? How do we even expect to harvest foods that depend on pollination if we have been dooming the honeybees all along.  We will have uncontrolled forest fires, flooding rains, tornadoes, mega-storms, volcanoes, earthquakes, dreadful heat, polar cold, tsunamis in all the usual places and evermore surprising places.  Just add solar flares to the mix, to take irreparably down parts of the power grid or put a UV-unprotected hole in the ozone layer and then how do we move forward. People should not expect the prior safety nets, such as insurance or government rescue, to make them whole -- these only work when a tiny percent suffer at a time. Buckle up, indeed.  Nearly inevitable at this point. 

Cvd will seem like a walk in the park, by comparison."
Simple. Global warming will kill hundreds of millions so when it happens we nuremburg trial every politician and CEO who contributed to those deaths.

North America could shut down entirely and it would make no difference to climate change if Asia does nothing.  Asia is doing nothing but complain the West won't pay them trillions to fix Asia's problems.  Mind you they don't actually want solutions.  They just want the money.

"A radio talk show host recently asked listeners to call in and say what their most important issue is for this election cycle. The answers were across the spectrum: economy, gas and food prices, wage/wealth inequality, culture war issues, health care, etc. Not one person mentioned the climate crisis. Good Lord! If the climate crisis isn’t resolved expeditiously, all the other issues, as important as they are, become moot. Wake up, people — or, to put it another way, GET WOKE!"

NOAA temp graphs clearly show that temps have barely budged since 1998. They have dropped for the last 6 years straight. Meanwhile we've used more fossil fuels in the last 20 years than during our entire history. How do you reconcile this with your myopic alarmism?
"Yeah... the IPCC Report is the watered-down, conservative version of events that isn't too frightening. We're doomed. We aren't going to do anything substantive. We needed to act back in the 1970s. I  would bet by 2030 global chaos will be well underway."

So many climate change deniers.
We are screwed. My dad told me the us government has a facility in Alaska that's manipulating the weather for means of population control and global warming is the cover up. I'm not kidding. Anyone else have extreme anxiety about global warming??
Nothing will be done until some catastrophical events happen
"If the earth warms up people will not need to have their heating on as much and so lower emissions from gas boiler's and the power stations will not have to produce as much energy , therefore the earth's temperature will stabilise . Simples"
"we're not going to terraform Mars into Earth 2, we're going to terraform Earth to Mars 2 "
Why should we dedicate our lives to the economy when its killing us off?
"Absolutely nonsensical report. How did all the hue and cry of the ozone hole disappear? Moreover, statistics from the past 200 years show that 93% of all greenhouse emissions were by the white imperialist western countries (US, Canada, EU, UK), 3% by China and 4% by the rest of the world. This is all about exerting racial hegemony over the rest of the world and prevent them from developing."
man does not create anything man does not make anything God almight he is the creator and maker of all things. man invente
"Our economy needs to degrow, focus more on caring for workers instead of who has the money, and stop mindlessly producing stuff that we cant fix and use longer."
"Climate change is and will be even more disasterous in and of itself. However, we also have increasing soil erosion rates, oil and ground water depletion, ocean acidification, coral reef death as bleaching events increase, changes to the Gulf Stream, AMOC , and ENSO. Furthermore biodiversity is being ravaged. I think we all want far too much of the good life. About 1.5 billion cars, trucks, vans, and motorcycles runnjng trillions of miles each year and burning up about 35,000,000,000 barrels of oil per year. The good news is that it can't last much longer! We won't have to purposefully decrease economic growth because it is entirely unsustainable. In a few years gas and diesel costs will be so high you'll hear a monumental screaching as the brakes are applied. The Saudi fields, the shale in the Permian Basin, the tar sands in Alberta, the Orinoco, and whatever can be found in Africa, the deep sea, and in the Arctic are becoming ever more expensive. The EROI (energy return on investment) for petroleum is no longer 100:1 or even 20:1. Next decade it will probably be less than 10:1 and you'll be paying more than $15 a gallon. People will be buying scooters and riding bicycles again. By 2040-2050 summer avg temps over our grain belts are going to decimate crop production. A few decades later crop production at scale ends because of erosion. Russia by this time will be providing most of the world's grain but it won't be nearly enough. The later half of this century will be characterized by food and fuel rationing and massive famines along with a diaspora of unprecedented magnitude. It will be the AGE OF THE WASTELAND. IT IS ON THE WAY."
All of it is extremely depressing
"It looks like the human race is not (enough) aware that 1° C permanent increase could mean the difference between life or death, 3° C is very very dangerous and soon nature calamities & destruction will follow as consequences of this massive increase, the Earth's ""immune system"" will respond and the human race is ironically ""the virus"" now."

"While Germany is not building more coal plants, electricity generation is no up to over 33%, up from 21% in 2021

Global coal consumption reached an all time high in 2022, lead by India and China. The reason? Decreasing cost of coal and increasing cost of natural gas.

My 2c - impose a duty tax based on the percentage of e where from coal, gas and oil. That tax is then used to incentivize greener resource production 

Likewise, a commodity tax on the trade of oil, gas and coal"

"All countries will be climate-neutral by 2030.
Humanity will have already disappeared."
"I don't know if they still hold these views, but years ago China and India argued that the United States and the West got rich by polluting and that they should be allowed the same consideration

I'm pointing this out because it highlights the attitude that most people want something done about climate change, as long as it is everyone else that is doing it

Another example that I can give is that in the United States the state that suffers the most from climate change is Alaska with the melting of the permafrost
However, in Alaska not only do they not pay state taxes the oil industry pays every person in Alaska $2000 a year for access to natural resources
So Alaska argues against any restrictions on the oil industry and fossil fuels because they are not willing to kill the golden goose

My advice is buy lots of sun screen"
no mention of changing diets or total transformation of how we live.
Climate change is occurring so slowly we are more likely to adapt before we slow it down even further. There are other threats to humanity that are far more dangerous.
Climate change is joke
WE ARE ALL 100% GOING TO FUCKING DIE
"They are trying to put the blame on ordinary people and the reality is the big companies and goverments are to blame. People are buying things and services that are available to them and following laws that were put to them. 
Looking back at the videos of Glasgow summit is really sad and says a lot about politicians.  From all those marvelous speeches I wonder is there even one leader of any country that stood up to their promise. There are too many promises but when it comes to taking decisions and they realise that decision will impact certain industry in the country they back off. Abandoning Russian gas due to war and replacing it with coal is no excuse because due to climate change there will be much more wars and we will have worse situation than today. Getting more energy from renewables is good but I think the newly installed energy can't cover the increase of energy spending. 
We are consuming too much energy and finding ways to cut that consumption is as important as the way of producing it and this model of constant growth of all economies will make us pay the price. When climate crisis peaks we will probably not hurry to make a big difference but rather to start a new war due to lack of resources like energy, food, water etc."
You goddamn liars…climate fraud over and over…
"So.. we have 7 years to replace over 1 billion cars.

"There is no sign of reduction in greenhouse emissions. In fact, emissions have increased after covid to unprecedented levels. Most countries are arming themselves to their teeth so that they can invade others and grab their resources to compensate for the impending shoratges at home. Even viral, bacterial, and fungal bioweapons have been prepared to induce pandemics and reduce the population of the planet. The global elite thinks that the lives of people are disposable, and a reduction in the population by a fraction can help reduce the need for resources and food."

Truth is we're in the midst of our demise - it's just not obvious to most yet."

"Mr. Guterres must know that explosives , jets and movements of troops and creation of millions of refugees cancels the billions asked of consumers to 'reverse or hold in check' climate change .

What have you done  to stop these damaging activities ? What have you done to stop the U.S. from being the major contributor of environmental damage ?

"You have the technical ability to solve it. If you don't stop the primitive windmill, solar, nonsense and start using nuclear energy you are dooming us all to primitive living. Start building nuclear plant right now if you want me to believe you're gibberish about CO2 disaster tipping point. If the tipping point happens, you so-called scientists are going be blamed for not recommending the nuclear solution.

"Emissions will NOT go down without an economic and population contraction of the human enterprise. No amount of electric cars and solar panels will reduce emissions one bit. In fact, the amount of fossil fuel burning needed to manufacture these things will actually increase emissions."

Satellite readings from the University of Alabama in Huntsville that measure temperatures in the troposphere have shown no global warming for eight years
The comment section here is proof that Exxon won.
"We needed to make the cuts in CO2 years.

Governments around the world are still subsidizing coal, oil and gas extraction.

A few weeks ago Ursula von der Leyen gave a speech about how the EU was spending loads of money on Carbon Capture and Storage, which is nonsense.  They are storing it in a oil field under the sea near Denmark.  This is used to extract more oil.  If you pump loads of CO2 into an oil field you get more oil coming out.  So the EU is helping the extraction of more oil and green washing it as CCS.

Not all the of government subsidies to extract more fossil fuels are green washed with all this CCS, mostly governments just give billions of pounds, euros and dollars to fossil fuel companies in projects to help them extract more fossil fuels.

There is no urgency to stop emitting CO2, it's just a big pantomime for politicians to win elections by looking like they are doing something when in reality they do nothing.  The warming is not going to stop at 1.5 degrees, it'll blast past 5 degrees no problem, and everyone will act surprised and hold a few more large conferences about what to do which will result in zero action.

"Fun facts - 

For every heat related death there are at least five cold related deaths.  There is credible evidence that warmer temperatures will save more people from suffering cold deaths then those who supposedly suffer from heat deaths 

There are more trees on earth today then there were a hundred years ago.  Satellite photos show that the earth is greener then a hundred years ago.

Overall climate deaths are down by 98% then from a century ago.  

The vast majority of CO2 comes from natural emissions, not from man made emissions.  

Lets hypothetically say that what doomsday prognosticators are true (the same folks who have been making these predictions for decades).  If the 'leaders of the climate catastrophe movement can't give up flying around on private jets and living in private mansions that create more CO2 emissions than a village in a poor country what would make a poor farmer who has to feed his family give up access to affordable energy?  The hypocrisy is visceral and the preaching is just a bunch of virtue signaling from people who don't want to live the same lifestyle they want to impose upon others."
We were custom made by this planet.
"Michael Mann is a hopium sell-out. He still claims 1.5 is possible despite knowing it isn't, because if he tells the TRUTH– which is that we are already locked in to at LEAST 2c warming even if emissions stop today– then the news won't have him on. The truth is worse than anything this report admits to."
😢😢😢Climate change
"Before the the alarmists brainwash you, look at trends from 100 years ago, 1000 years ago, 2,000 years ago, 5,000 years ago?  The trend goes back further than the human impacts and is unavoidable. Since oil is a finite resource, we should conserve, to plan for our lack of heat for our homes or transportation of goods and services."
"This seems horrible already now.
But realize, this will got worse and worse...

CO2 emissions do not cause climate change.
"There is no statistically significant evidence of any rise in frequency or intensity of severe weather events over the course of the past century. The so-called ""catastrophic man-made climate change"" is a monumental lie peddled by some western elites and their brainwashed lackeys the very purpose of which is to dupe, disenfranchise, and impoverish the middle class, and for people of developing countries to forgo development."

"Excellent program!     But the point not presented or underlined is the 1.2 trillion tons of melting ice worldwide, with projections of 2/3 of all ice gone by 2,100.     The melting ice is our best indicator of the climate crisis and the desperate need NOT to elect legislators or presidential candidates who yell ""drill, baby, drill!""      If you think we're in trouble now, just imagine a world without the massive cooling effects of global ice, including 2 ice caps, sea ice, permafrost, and 200,000 glaciers, all of which are rapidly melting.     We must dramatically reduce our individual carbon footprints, even though the fossil fuel funded corporate propagandists tell us its the government who should save us from ourselves.    Don't believe their BS and reassess your personal fossil fuel burning activities for reduction now!     Time for my afternoon walk down to the river and back.     HAPPY HOLIDAYS!"
"At about 3:20 the ""expert ""  seems to imply that if emissions stop then  things will cool off in a human relevant time scale. They won't.  It will take thousands of years for any degree of recovery."
"lets talk ""CLIMATE CHANGE"", and I have to put my 2 cents in. I started a home oxygen business, where I would provide oxygen to COPD patients that needed supplement oxygen at home. I had many years prior experience delivering home oxygen to patients. I also was involved with the FDA (food & drug administration), filling oxygen tanks, and giving oxygen training to nursing homes, hospitals, etc. Here is my opinion on climate change. It is a total scam, not worthy of disscusion. The earth atmosphere is made up of 21% oxygen and 98% nitriogen. The remaing 1% is trace gases. This has been the same since it was discovered in 1700's or1800's. IT IS STILL THE SAME TODAY. So if the carbon emmissions are destroying the earth, ask yourself why hasen't the oxygen level changed? IT HAS NOT CHANGED AT ALL.  Its all about $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
When is someone going to address the effect that thousands of bombs being dropped on Gaza has on the environment.
"the sad fact is that climate change IS here to stay and it isn't going anywhere. its just going to become more intense and profound,a few western countries that totally drop fossil fuels will accomplish nothing at all.the real problem is that we have over 8 billion humans roaming around this planet willy nilly pretty much breeding at will and doing what ever pleases them. now i'm not proposing anything crazy like euthanasia that would be terrible and totally sick but the time HAS COME that over populated countries must start enforcing or mandating some birth control measures because ideally this planet should have a population that's no more than 2 billion or so!!"
"My first hurricane, 1964, carla, I would never want to live on the coast ever again, and I don't, I have to this day not another such experience, I was a child then, I will never be a child again!"

There is no such thing as climate change.
No to Michael Mann. And his book. Don't look up.
Climate will always changes there were ice ages in the past and will come again in the future need to learn to adjust to the changes
"In earth day , like. 30-40% 9f people respect the planet continuously over the years. It’s almost like humans are causing climate change and are making there own planet extinct for there own actions. More people need to respect the world around us so we could live in harmony."
This all crap.  Carbon is not pollution
"People Power has the potential to:
Make cheap clean power anywhere,
Reduce most unemployment anywhere,
Eliminate poverty through stored energy sales  anywhere. 

First what is people power? 

Power out from a storm or disaster?
There's People Power, any low tech solution that would bring power to any stricken area where people are. Wind and water turn wheels to make power, but so can people. Yes it can be stored ahead of time. Yes it's portable.  Yes it's inexpensive. Yes it's good for the environment. Yes it's safe.
People Power, free power in any emergency, anywhere there are people. 

Next...
People Power not only could make energy in an emergency power outage,  but that type of low tech could also store energy for future use.  That stored energy could be kept for backup, used in that area, or transfered and sold somewhere else. 

We also know that there are places in the world where many people need work.  Why not combine the two. Out of work people could be hired to use their physical power to make energy. They would not need much training, and virtually any healthy adult could do it full time or part time.
Next the extra money generated, could be used to buy solar panels to augment their revenues. 

What we must insure is that these workers are paid a fair, honest wage, and treated well. This can never be forced labor. 

Sum up: This is clearly a win win for everyone: Healthy power, many new unskilled jobs, and the end of poverty anywhere in the world,  all in a new power industry."
"So, want hard proof of climate change being driven by humans burning fossil fuels and generating massive amounts of heat energy?     No?    Well, read on anyway!     We are losing 1.2 trillion tons of global ice annually due to that ice absorbing all that mostly human generated heat.    We are burning 8 billion tons of coal a year and 100 million barrels of oil every day, which is generating most of that ice melting heat, which in turn needs to be absorbed if we want to keep living on this planet.     So, question of the moment: when does the ice run out and the natural AC shut down?     My extrapolation from the Copernicus prediction is the year 2,138.     Ah, you say, who cares?     Thinking of bring another child into this world at this late stage in our unfolding existential crisis?      2,138 (115 yrs./3 = 38) is about 3 generations from right now, so great grandchildren?     Hmmmm?"
soo call lamborghini and ferrari factory to stop sport car production v8  for rich people !!! but you not gonna do that!!😅😅😅 you are JOKERS!!!  is only excuse for politisc to change the law for poor people ...PROPAGANDA
The Grift that keeps on Grifting 🎉😮
"I am sick and tired of my future being dictated by some ancient politicians acting all righteous. I have decades left to live, yet I feel so hopeless just watching it all get turned into ruin at the hand of governmental bodies. Younger generations should not be forced to take responsibilities for your actions and decisions!"
Let's remember that the largest contributor is the US Military. Maybe stopping these wars would do much more for everyone.
15 times as many people die from cold in the US than from heat.  Bring it on.
Don't expect food prices to get any lower.
Is this your attempt to sound the alarm?  Seems like the tone is: “hit the snooze button again”
"Please listen to this summary of facts and terrible events.  Then vote for those who will act legislatively to stop/and/ or  greatly reduce Methane, CO2, and Nitrous Oxide emissions."
Nothing nore than propaganda trash!👈
"It has nothing to do with climate change,"
The real impact on the climate are the alarmist that push a fake agenda. Years of neglect because of these idiots is why we have these mega fire.
Thank you
"Until we reduce globalization, it will not help climate change."
"I'm shocked at how many people have been brainwashed into believing in this ""climate change"" scam. Mankind is not the leading producer of ""climate change"", the Sun is. So lets go back to 1000b.c technology and see what happens to modern day humanity, I bet there will be French Revolutions all over the world cause the peasant class will not be oppressed by the monarchy for long, just ask William Wallace and George Washington. Jul 15, 2023 — Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday called on the US to “reduce population” in an effort to combat climate change. This is the real goal of ""climate change"", population reduction. ""Climate change"" is scam that takes money from the poor to the rich, just ask Al Gore who became a multi-millionaire due to ""climate change."" Also, just saw a news clip of some nut job woman saying, ""Climate change is not about saving the world but saving us."" So they now admit that it's not about saving the earth, but about saving the rich from death cause most rich people fear death as they are godless pagans.  Only Jesus Christ can save humanity, not rich communists."
oh boy
"The crazy part is, this is only the beginning, but it was also written that this would happen. And no one will do a thing to change it we can't. It's over it's too late the world is already on fire literally"
"USA weather channel founder exposed the govt tax grab over a decade ago
Millions AWAKE"
"No mention of the collapse of food production because of climate problems! That will be the killer, because no food and society collapses!"
Thank you for keeping us  inform on what is going on with mother nature
"I’m a huge proponent of changing everything to try to stop Climate Change, but guys - Michael Mann is trash. He blocks literally everyone, regardless of whether you understand/“believe in” ACC or not."
2023 summer caused climate change worse remember that summer heat was too much hot
"""...But climate change hurts my conservative feelings so it must be fake"" 😂"
"The planet doesn't need protection.  It was climate change that created the great lakes , grand canyon , the great planes   etc . Its been going on  since earth was created . Its a cycle  ,nothing stays the same ."
"The man made climate change is like cancer once it's detected and people tend to ignore it,it will get worse, it's eating our planet with sores, you know the Aritic sinkholes are full of mathane, and we see those all over the earth. Can man survive extreme heat weather?"
We need to plant lots and lots of Bamboo
"Science is in reality only in its infancy. Look we have not proved or disproved such things as UFO's , Life After Death or Quantum Consciousness, Big Foot and many more alleged cited creatures. We've only been able to drill 40,000 feet in the Earth. The Kola Superdeep Borehole. We really have zero Idea if there will or will not be an World War 3, Armageddon Nuclear War. Nor do we know if China deliberately sent us Covid- 19 OR/AND will there be new deliberate Killer Plagues/Pandemics coming soon. There are so many questionable futures that pinpointing one as the number 1 issue to take on is very complicated. So many futures yet defined. Reducing fossil fuel acquisition now and then WW3 happens the next year will make it hard to rebuild as the few millions that survive nuclear war may find fossil fuels the best option again. AND with only say 20 Million humans on Earth in 2025 we will have enough gas & oil to last another 200 hundred years. Choose your future wisely. If I was young and had family I would find a good tropical forest to farm in and have horses for some travel options. Forgot an Asteroid Strike that would also cause havoc. Its also a popular Biblical Prophecy called the ""Wormwood Prophecy."" They called asteroids, meteorites stars as they didn't have telescopes back then. So by the amount of damage predicted it sounds like another asteroid like the one that allegedly killed the Dinosaurs. What we eat will depend on what's available. I'm sure 1800s cowboys in our USA west would chew the bones of a chicken to get full. Sheepshead fish are very bony but you can put them in a blender and crush the bones up good and get more calcium. We eat what's available."
"What caused the storm that caused the storm that caused, The Night of the Big Wind in Ireland in 1839?"
So have we breached 1.5 or not?
"I am sick of people say that it's people they are causing Climate change.

We all know the world has heated up and cooled off dozens of times in the last  100,000 years

That is because the Earth has volcanoes as its natural heater.

Right now el nino in the ocean has volcanoes going off, causing warmer weather . Somehow, they're gonna try to say it's people.

Never has the world deep Freeze or warmed up because of the people. These are natural acts of what the earth goes through

Everyone's got theories.  the rich that think we need to get rid of the population over this.

It's gotta be some of the dumbest people on earth to believe this

The earth warms up with volcanoes they are its natural heating system. Not people or the actions of people.

That does not take a rocket scientist to figure out. World leaders are trying to hold a summit for something that cannot be changed

Just like you can't stop the North Pole from moving, it is always moving faster every year picking up speed.. The weather will change.

Scientists know this years ago. They've shot into the ice and could tell you. The world has warmed up and cooled off many other times. With in the last 100,000 Never did people have anything to do with this"
"😂😂😂Climate control is a scam!!!! It's all about control, fear, and money!!!!"
"今年は日本でも最強の猛暑に見舞われたがこの番組でアメリカも相当酷い事が判った。
興味深かったのはハリケーン等と異なり猛暑被害は写真では判別出来ない箇所。（実際に体験しなければ判らない）
日本では合わせて開発中の脱炭素技術をTVで自慢げに紹介し、多数の人が温暖化は解決出来ると勘違いしたが、その大半は実現していない。
その様な状態で時間が経ち、もうかなり危険な水準になってしまったと今年少しづつ気付き始めた段階です。
世界中が暑くなり、今後インドだけでも年間300万台レベルでエアコンが増加する見込みらしい。
エアコンの室外機は部屋を冷やす以上に室外機から熱を出すので少しでも省エネを心掛けないと、この数年で地球温暖化は更に別次元に進んでしまう可能性が高まっている。

それと驚いた事はアメリカは日本より神様を信じている人が多い認識なのに熱波で人が死んでも気候変動に否定的な書込みが多い。
あなた方は近いうちに神様から罰せられると思うよ。
少なくとも神様がいれば、不要な人を減らして他の動植物を残す道を選ぶ可能性は有ると思う。
更に暑くなればクーラーの恩恵すら受けられない動植物は一気に減少する恐れが有るからね。
ノアの箱舟とかもそれを警告する逸話だと思います。"
"In the future, there will be no such thing as ""insurance companies""... 😂"
It’s. Over.
I was here
Hogwash
"Forest fires 
Current burn acreage is 80% lower than peak burn in the 1930s, per US Dept of Agriculture, National Report on Sustainable Forests - 2010 pg II-48. (Wikipedia)."
"Somewhere a King paid a family to throw one apple per day into a river for five generations. That's thousands of apples. Somewhere downstream, there will probably be apple trees; eventually. 
Somewhere ine day a philanthropist paid for a family to pay attention where the pollution from the river meets the sea. That family developed svere depression. 
I made this up. Apple a day and all that."
"The globalists (WEF, google it) want to reduce the population. Destroying farms in the name of climate change will create mass starvation."
Climate change is a hoax the population bomb is real earth can not feed support this population growth.  If govt cared they would do something about that. They only care about the money grab from tax payers or from USA to implement green which they won't do anyways once they get your money it goes into their pockets
"If climate change is so dire, why did many delegates fly to the United Nations Climate Change Summit on private jets??"
I think it's from too much space junk.
"Here's a simple truth about climate and megastorms: we are adding enormous amounts of heat energy into the environment and that energy is driving bigger and more frequent storms.      How do we know we're adding enormous amounts of heat energy?      1.2 trillion tons of ice is melting on the two ice caps, the 200,000 glaciers, the sea ice, and the permafrost.     It is impossible to come up with a total for the planet, at least for me.    Maybe you can work it out?"
"Oh please, just stop it with the ""severe weather"" nonsense.  Throughout the history of recorded time, the weather has changed, and I suspect that it will continue to change, natural disasters and all."
Need more news covering climate in a truthful and down to earth way. Great stuffski
"Michael Mann, the person who tried to destroy the ""Medieval Warm Period"", who tried to erase the ""Little Ice Age"",  we have been lied to, this person is not so smart, he has fooled many of us! There is no ""Climate Crisis"""
Why does it seem impossible to separate the science from the politics. I don't know its a conundrum or there's a ton of money too be made keeping the status quo.
"LOL why do people believe this nonsense anymore? If any of you bothered to actually read the IPCC reports you would know there is no trend in extreme weather events. The trend in hurricanes is actually slightly down over the last 50 years. This is nothing more than scare mongering. There is always some kind of weather event and has been throughout the history of the world. The only difference is that now the media focuses on any event and blames it on climate change. Heck the worst flood in my memory occurred way back in 1978 (when we were worried about humans causing an ice age) in the Plaza area of Kansas City. 

If you say something long enough and loud enough you can get people to believe almost anything no matter how ridiculous. Heck most of you thought wearing a paper mask would prevent you from catching a virus."
Such bs...
"Up until 1980 the scientist were claiming every years that the cooling trend is steady and show no sign of reversal. 

Now, scientists consensus say that the evidences is that the climate is getting hotter since before 1950. 

Soooo, which scientist are right?"
"“The sky is falling the sky is falling” chicken little… Death from natural disasters are down 98% since the year 1900… This is the largest scam of my lifetime, green energy the people who profit from it the politicians who profit from it? “there’s a sucker every minute“ PT Barnum."
"“I accepted to come to this meeting to have a sober and mature conversation. I’m not in any way signing up to any discussion that is alarmist. There is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5C.” Sultan Al Jaber, President of COP28

Seems more and more likely, scenario SSP5-8.5 of the IPCC assessment may come to fruition (or at least the higher end of the spectrum). Enjoy what you can, while you still can; pity the generations to come."
Oceanic garbage is awful 😞 make California and New York clean it up. Disgusting. Same as the atmosphere garbage 🗑️
"When will people take this danger seriously?
Prepare now and make leaders address this topic every year!"
climate change is a hoax
CBS what is climate change?
"Yeah and it's not going to change if China, India and other rapidly industrialising nations don't reduce emissions. Everything else is a drop in the ocean."
Yeah those solar panels made of plastic which is from fossil fuels last 20 years then go into land fills never to be broken down.  Then there's those batteries in cars all made in China who doesn't care about emissions.  Where do dead batteries go? Ocean.  Green new b.s. because no one looks at the tools they plan on using is worse than fossil fuel.
maybe the aliens can save the world or bob geldof and his pals.
Ruminant animals deployed correctly is the answer. Local action not national policies.
This really upsets me.

Hoax
In other words we need to raise the prices on fuel and oil til we have paid for enough renewables that they can switch us over

Meh… that ship has sailed

"There's me wanting, actually preying Britain becomes a warm country before the ice age hits. So, V8's for everyone and run over all climate cult twats in the road"
Lol the ones saying we need to change for the better to halt climate change are the ones who have always and always will be the ones to pollute the planet and then try to hide it it’s comical lol
"And if we do all these Carbon measures, how much is this going to prevent the global warming Sir? Assuming our Friends China and others will do the same? ???"
"UN doesnt know that climate and our SUN are related, and our SUN have cooling periods and periods with more activity"

Then get f-ing started, stop talking and do something"
If we act now 1970s. If we act now 1980s and 90s. If we act now 2000s. Yeah we haven’t done nothing and when gas prices rise making people drive less and consume less governments do everything to lower prices. Starting the consumption cycle again. Humans are dumb we deserve what is coming bring it on.
The irony being all of the Russian gas dependant countries are firing up coal fire plants all over Europe.... Great reset anyone?
Might as well keep using fossil fuels then. Sorted.
Russia is cutting the gas off. So that should help…
"The more warming, the better!  The sooner, the better.  I want 5 degrees C warming and meters of ocean rise by 2050!!"
"Well climate change is really obvious, we don’t get snow in winter now, we get most of it in spring and all the seasons are fucked. And the ice is melting rapidly."
More things to worry about than global warming.
"Political science, wheres the actual science ..."
"How much are the white west paying to the global south to prevent the catastrophie? After all the major consumers in the world are white western people that has led to this situation. This is a racial war and the white west now realises the damage it has caused to the planet after centuries of exploitation, colonisation, imperialism and the domination of the global south and now wants to limit the development of people of color in the global south without contributing substantially towards combating climate change by continuing to dominate the world."
LIES LIES LIES LIES
"Solar geoengineering, carbon sequestration, arrest oil tycoons for lying to the public while knowing about this for years,

Time to take this seriously."
I don’t understand how every single government in the world is so corrupt and so useless that they just care for their own greed and power
"so china and india can keep pumping out 80% and uk is 2% and it is our problem,wake uk next big goverment scam £££££££££££££"
"The UN is yet another western globalist mouthpiece and should be shut down for the good of humanity… Global warming is not a thing, Climatards are the problem, not the solution?!"
More bullshit....is the pandemic and the war nit enough??? More FEAR MONGERING AND BRAIN WASHING THE PEOPLE!!!!!!!
"Climate change is planned to be the next ruse to perpetuate this maximum control on the spurious grounds of 'public health' nonsense. Get ready to counter it.
For a start - We are made of carbon. All life needs Carbon dioxide. Plants need certain levels of carbon dioxide maintained in order to grow! As do We!"
"Why is the West suddenly concerned with global warming after knowing the effects during their industrial revolution. Now that emerging nations are building their industries they’re becoming the scapegoats for heating the planet. Enough of the fear mongering, climate change is a natural occurrence."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBv7NEryntg  we should try to make some change for the sake of posterity

Absolute rubbish only 1% of co2 is created by mankind
What happened to the hole in the ozone layer.  That was death by cancer for people. .

"Oh no, not again."
"These so called ""scientists"" have a conflict of interest.  They lose their paychecks and pensions if they prove otherwise, because there would be no need for them any longer.  The UN can't be trusted since they are pushing for a one world government, with themselves being in charge."
Make our lives miserable with their green agenda which have zero impact compared to what China and India are pumping out every day.
Only because they say so👎
Just ban Twitter. That will cut down on harmful emissions. Job done.

"Sounds like a conspiracy theory, stop spreading mis information! Fact check false! This narrative is worse then the Covid narrative. It’s not based on “the science” or “the data”!

"There'll be little political action until most voters in affluent nations push for change.

"Or if the density of the air increases, the pressure rises.  Heat reduces the density, all other things being equal, but it also increases the evaporation of water creating more of the much denser water vapor, offsetting the density reduction due to heating.  Every degree increase in GAST increases water vapor content, on average, by 7%."

In my city drinking fountains are being installed all over the place and new trees planted everywhere there is space.  In summer months cooling places will have to be open. Some of the population will have to leave city for some months. The problem is you can't be always in one place all day. And there are construction and utility workers working in in the open whole day."
"We must stop adding more fossil fuels to the Climate Fire. 
Floods, droughts, fires, extreme temperatures are all becoming more common.
Time to go all in on wind and solar energy and all electric vehicles.
How extreme does the weather have to get before people wake up and stop burning fossil fuels."
It would be more useful to see the excess deaths attributed to both hot and cold weather.  Humans tend to die in greater numbers in cold weather.  It's a zero sum loss if an old person dies from hot weather instead of cold weather...that likelihood will depend on their wealth...the wealthy one will have an air to air heat pump and will stay moderately warm in winter and moderately cool in summer...the poor one will muddle through or move to a more hospitable climate or die.
We're doomed
Heatwaves! Woot!
"Europeans will become Indians, trust me on this !"
"Since the weather nowadays is no significantly different from the weather in the past we can easily answer this question by perusing existing meteorological records for past weather if we go sufficiently far back, say, a millennium or more. And, of course, it is a blatant lie to claim that ""heat waves are killers."" Far more people die of cold exposure than of heat, especially in Britain's underheated homes, when temperatures drop well below freezing in winter and the elderly don't have enough money to pay exorbitant energy bills. The remedy for hot weather is simple and well known to e.g. Australian natives and others who happen to live in the south, Italians, Spaniards, Greeks, Arabs. Stay in the shade, drink plenty of water, wear loose clothing, or none at all, do not exert yourself. And remember, only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the mid-day sun. Switch your social and other activities to nights. If you have AC, use it. Here in Los Estados Unidos, where AC was invented, every home is equipped in double glazing and central heating and cooling."
WADR to the late great Richard Pryor “we will see”!
Solar Blanketing ( Geo Engineering ) is the main climate change culprit across the earth.  The fact that no one can openly talk about it speaks volumes this insidious decades long program of climate manipulation.
"We had zero last summer,,,since forever somewhere it reaches 100 during, get over it,,,polars still got their ice…fake news for over 20 years!!!!"
"If we look at the earth in total, where has the water gone too if everywhere is hot ?"
Well that’s great. Now do one on the significantly more people that die each year due to cold. Because I’m sure you would like to be seen as balanced.

The result of a diminishing atmosphere caused by over-consumption of molecular oxygen that allows more UV energy to reach the Earth's surface where it becomes light and then HEAT. One of the most successfully obscured truths thanks to generous contributions by the petroleum lobbyists.

"Oliver Morton? Cripes, I thought it was George Monbiot!"
I couldn't focus on this story...kept getting distracted by Oliver Morton's awesome beard
"Heat was so great, that this guy’s beard went up to his cheeks"
"So biased; a chart was shown about weather related deaths, all were included but cold related deaths which was not included, I guess the scale of the graph would have to be adjusted to such an extent that it would not be graphically viable; or, they, for some reason, absolutely had to not include it as would destroy the narrative!"
Please print a transcript of this and tape it to everyone's foreheads. I'm tired of listening to this same message for decades and having people still in denial about it and its causes.
Nobody is denying that the climate does change that is totally logical. What is illogical is that man is causing this I know of climate scientists saying this is not true. They get institutionally bullied for trying to bring true science forward for discussion and debate. The current narrative is a falsity much like the lockdown and COVID bullying we saw.
their was fog in summer wiht out rain
"7 june 2023 1 am Mumbai ,India feels like Temperature 42℃/107.6°F🥵."
I’m NOT excited for these next 5 years of extreme heat. Sadly all those new ACs in India will contribute majority to the issue of global warming.

"Heat wave, read about the heatwave that came down on Santa Barbara, California in 1859!  Birds fell dead out of the trees, farm animals killed over and people sought relief in the shade of buildings with thick walls.   The recorded temp. was 133 degrees.  A record that held for nearly a hundred years.  If this hits again we will lose thousands of people.  Cars will heat over, freeway stops and a disaster will occur."
Chrichton guessed in 2004 w/a computer mode variation of 400% (pretty large) that the increase would be 0.812436 degrees … seems like it might get pretty toasty — STATE OF FEAR pg 570🥂✌️

"Climate Change. hahah. Funny. In the past 10 years Australia has had an average temperature of -0.1% less since previous decades. . Thats minus if you didn't notice. My Great Grandmother lives 40 meters from the ocean. She's 100 and 6 months old. I've been visiting for 50 years. Strange how the ocean hasn't changed. Not one bit. haha. You'd think because her house is 3.5 meters above sea level that it would be washed away by now in a King Tide.. Very strange that.. Maybe, just maybe, it's all a load of BS. ."
"Now that the climate emergency is irreversible and 50°c will be increasingly accepted, leader's are shown as incompetent and criminal in action"
"Go on then. Push the globalist’s climate agenda. Heat annually kills people in the ten thousands. Cold is killing people in the millions every year. But of course you don’t talk about that. Would fit the global warming agenda, right?"
one time we had 35 it was the best summer of my live cause no humidity

well lucklie it gets now even more humide to the point ot cools down
refreshing to see lack of idiotic denialism in the comments...Bravo

"blah, blah man made CO2 causing climate change is the biggest hoax of all time. Vastly more people die from cold than heat. This kind of gaslighting is embarrassing to intelligent people and dangerous for those that are brainwashed. It was much hotter in the 1930s look it up."

Heat is in the process of killing all life on Earth.
"Southern US is hot, starting as far north as Minnesota. 110 days there decades ago, and that was they she goes, it was hot. Stay inside or be in the lakes. Understand climate and what landmasses do to air: it warms it in summer and it tends to hang around. Elevation is also key. Inland Alaska at 1000ft elev. frequently hits 90+ which is hot, while somewhere in wyoming thousands of miles south at 6000 ft does not get above 80."
"Cold weather is the bigger killer, ain't it?"
"Thanks for doing this ! One of the issues I have with journalism these days is that they don’t break down the implications of climate change and what it means for us. So people keep thinking, well it’s just going to be a couple degrees warmer, more time for swimming in the pool …. It’s these kinds of formats that are essential"
Fact - cold kills more than heat. Fact - CO2 has no correlation with temp throughout history. Fact- we've only increased temp by 1.2 degrees since the little ice age which is most welcome. Fact - no correlation between CO2 and extreme weather throughout history. Fact - warming maybe less than measured due to less weather stations in rural areas. Fact - warming is being used for political control purposes based on lies that could destroy the very concept of freedom.

"There’s a book, “Five Times Worse”, that makes an interesting argument. We’re depending on scientists to tell us what can happen, but science deals in certainty, and doesn’t like “maybe”. So significant risk scenarios aren’t warned about, or even discussed - or even properly researched. So we wind up talking a lot about “Can we keep it to 1.5c?”, and not at all about “What if it breaks 5c?” We cannot afford to plan based only on certainty. We have to consider what MIGHT happen."

If we're in the middle of a climate emergency why are people still allowed go on holidays? Why have all flights not being cancelled like they were during COVID?
the End is near
No surprise we are in a heatwave. Mining and development are pushing up trees all over the world. That's fewer trees to absorb the carbon dioxide and fewer trees to shade the earth from the sun. Have you ever watched GOLD RUSH?
Boy were they WRONG...AGAIN.  the summer was mostly RAINY...
"Coldest summer in many years where i live, and fucking raining all the time..."
Excellent review of the hot weather! UK.
That's why they have to keep saying it over and over and over its hot hot hot but it isn't that hot it's just this is how the rats and the mainstream media try to train people AKA brainwash.
"Here in the S.W. of the UK, the summers are becoming cooler and wetter, we are lucky when we have a day above 20C. The Jet Stream headed South while it was West of the UK, it looks like it may have contributed towards the South of Europe 'scorcher'. Could the 'Cold Blob' in the North Atlantic contributed towards this, with the runoff of melted snow from Greenland?."
If anything is causing it is planes spraying shit that turns in to clouds. The elite ruch are behind everything that happens in this world.
"The Climate prophets are prophecying a heat wave Summer season for the whole of Australia.🥵 Their disciples are saying, We Know, that this Summer will be the hottest Summer season ever"". Did you get that?! They  KNOW!.😂"

I remember when I was a kid there were heat waves like this and I'm 64. So this is normal.
She says she has been going there 20 years . I thought this was a ‘ NEW ‘ thing a record breaking Heat Wave. LMFAO doing it for 20 years shatters that illusion
So far in the Eastern USA it's been a mild summer and there is no climate crises.
Great video but these people are lazy and stubborn will continue to drive around cities and towns and factories will continue fossil fuel emissions so now we are here at this dangerous point from perhaps there is no recovery from.
Nature is working to correct the imbalance created by humans.. 😂😂
The savage war that Putin decided to create in Ukraine doesn't help to stop climate warming.

people crying about heat meanwhile here in kuwait it's casual to get 50-52°C maybe  instead of crying pray and make ur bond with god stronger and stay patient.
"Utter crap - it was minus 86C in Antarctica a few days ago and the MSM never mentioned it! ""The hottest day in 50 years is definitely hot, but certainly not unprecedented""."

Could overpopulation have something to do with it?
"We Indians developed dark skin ova 1000's of years exposure to Indian summers. Now I hope PPL will appreciate treee instead of chopping forests for palm oil cultivation. Palm oil trees evolved in desserts hence their leaf structure doesn't trap as much dew/ moisture as a fully grown forest tree the act of trapping moisture to return to the forest floor brings life to millions of life forms that depend on it & in turn keep nature in balance but when you clear out lands & put concrete & tar in its place you alter everything. California drought is decades old bec their politicians diverted wetlands water for commercial cultivation. Also the water wars doc shows how corrupt officials diverted water from other states away from California. This is 1 example , across the globe it's no more global warming but global roasting !"
"""It's hotter than love' what my late beloved mother born in 1908 used to say! Heat turns to droughts lead to these horrific wildfires akin to ''Dante's Inferno' and loss of life in all it's forms! So let's not just sit around talking about it, let's DO something about it before it's too late! END antiquated fossil fuels and GO SOLAR and electric! Get rid of all the gas guzzling cars, trucks, buses, planes etc and go solar/electric! And get rid of those ugly humongous cruise ships that are polluting the oceans and destroying places like Venice Italy with it's over tourism! We should all be using bikes when we can like China did before they ditched them and replaced them with cars etc! Think GREEN, think cooler , think Global and ACT locally! ""IF we destroy the environment we won't have a society' per the late American cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead in the early/mid 20th century! Tell me about it!"
"Ofcourse heat could be deadly in some situations, but people seem to forget how much more brutal and deadly cold and frigid air could be in a lot of places if just the electricity and heat sources happen to wipe out of function. 
Warmth is still the big key to the civilization, dont forget that."
Fear Porn making it possible for the sheep to accept their Luciferian UN Agenda 2030 / Great Reset Climate Change lockdowns.
Say something said such 2-4000 years ago and people wouldn't turn and rejected which such said would cause great heat and people would be say angry by Mentioned what would you do ? Well say Prophecies like all cultures have if one had an answer would people say repent to give him glory or say it's man's humans  actions physically and not say spiritually and physically can fix it by actually say slowly  destroying it more thinking technology can do it ?
here its august cause its this mopist and the wader carries the heat on
"Good evening wion im Jerry Yan,✍️"
Lets plant trees .. big tree ..in our front house .. tree only available on earth.   None in mars or moon.   Trees is god gift to earth its natural machine to cooldown earth from nature
That's why there's places in America that never even hit records in heat temperatures it hasn't even been 100° in Wisconsin
They should not have interviewed that hiker afterwards...the Croatian lady needs sunscreen on her neck area as well...American homeless are being treated worse than zoo animals. Otherwise everything is fine...jk.

I really enjoy your reporting.  Thank you.
Nevertheless CO2 emissions go up on daily basis.
"Well the deadly summer came and went, now time for everyone to grow up and behave like adults"
earth just needs to collaborate and create a revolving heat shield. only covers the direct rays ( i know its fantasy)
"First of all. NO heatwave is hitting Europe, yes it has been very hot in a few places but that's it."

July is the coldest month in my country Kenya.
Need to stop modifying the weather.  Natural disasters including heatwaves have always been with us but these have been worsening since mankind has developed technology and agents that manipulate the weather for one reason or another.

With it finally being October and everything starting to cool down a little. I say good riddance to the this Heatwave.
The surprising thing here is nobody has mentioned the ocean tempreture risen to 8.3 now that is scary very scary.

The Mongolian plateau is experiencing 212 degrees Fahrenheit in the daytime and minus 50 degrees in the night.  This is typical of chemical weapons use in the 1970s when the Dali lama evacuated Tibet.

"Seems too many ""experts???"" have sold out to the agenda! Climatechange is real and Humans had a big part in their weather modification programs , weather warfare, and bunker fuels from ships , as well as wildfires , factoryfires , But the volcanoes spewing gasses and lava, as well as the oceans heating from Underneath and mas spraying chemical as a fire retardant! Where are people's brains.    Seems most are scrambled, bamboozled , and under the spell of media, all brainwashed and can't see what's in front of their faces!!!!
 Look up for the heavens have set a stage that tells an old old story!

"Why don't they ever point the finger at the adults/parents who are running to the banksters to go into debt to buy/use a personal gas guzzling machine so they can pump CO2 into the atmospheric gas chamber to accelerate the average global temperature rise to exterminate the children of humanity and creation by AGW so they can enjoy their lifestyle 
Maybe the adults/parents can stop buying/using those personal gas guzzling machines and sacrifice their fossil fuel lifestyle,  then the fossil fuel industry won't have support to keep going"

"We've had one of the longest winter's in year's and it's still cold here in the Pacific it's like a miracle because we're close to the equator and our summer's tend to last longer while winter's only a week's with the last 2 years just a few day's of cold weather and back too very hot, this year has been different because of the cold 🥶"
"You people not only manipulate the narrative but also the data. There is nothing unusual about the weather changing. There has been no increase in global temperatures for 18 years. Why do you people always start your data sets from 1850 ?  well because as you well know that was the end of the little ice age when temperatures were about 2c colder than today . So of course it has warmed and when the air warms the oceans release vast amounts of co2 back into the atmosphere . Lets go back in time , there have been warm periods and cold periods. From about 600AD to about 900 AD was the Roman warm period , then it cooled , then we had the Medieval warm period from about 1100 to 1400 when temperatures were hotter than todays, even the ice was gone from Greenland and was farmed by the Danes . Then there was the little ice age 1450 to 1800 when it was bitterly cold with short cool summers and long cold winters. Crops failed all over the northern hemisphere. The Thames river in London used to freeze over and they had markets etc on the ice. However 1815 was the last time it happened , and the temperatures have gone up since then , not to the same extent of the previous warm periods , in fact we are currently in the coldest warm period for 18,000 years, this warming and cooling is because the earth is still in an ice age , the Pleistocene ice age which has been going for 2.5 million years and its a certainty that in the next 2,000 years we will have another glaciation  . Climate change or warming and cooling is not as simple as these kinds of people make out and it is not from burning oil, coal , and gas . Climate change happens as a result of the Sun, the elliptical  orbit of the earth around it , the tilt of the earth which changes by 2.6 degrees every 40,000 years , clouds , cosmic rays , and our path through the Milky way , and water vapour is never mentioned by alarmists because it is the main greenhouse gas 97% in fact , co2 is less than 3% and anthropogenic co2 is 0.0012% . So the idea that humans can somehow change or manipulate the climate or temperatures by altering behaviour is just absurd nonsense. Most alarmist scientists blame co2 for climate change and warming, well if you are trying to prove that the 3% of anthropogenic co2 causes warming then you would also have to prove that the 97% of naturally occurring co2 from the earth itself does NOT cause warming."
"No!, humans "" have not done enough"" to curb or stop climate change. They just keep overbreeding and over populating the planet. This is a majo contributor to the problem. If breeding only 1-2 babies would've been enforced decades ago, it would have stabilized the lower planet populous, thus less gasses, less polution a, less usage. Politicians won't talk about this because all they care about is getting voted into their cushy high paying jobs. The bottom line is.... Human greed has caused climate change. Humans are self destructive because they're so greedy.... Refusing to stop all behaviors and all usage. Humans- still the great white ape, still not evolved enough to care for,their only home, the Earth."
There will be a point when power generation and transmission systems and substations shut down because of heat. Every home & business should disconnect from the power grid - this will force real conservation of energy.

No. It's geoengineering.
No.
Capitalism created this problem. Capitalism will never save us from it.
The old guy is completely delusional. Wow.
No. This is moronic
Nothing will change because our governments are under CORPORATE RULE. The very ones CAUSING this problem are the ones MAKING THE RULES. America is corrupted by CORPORATE donations and legal purchasing of politicians. It is a BEHEMOTH. Demonic and always EATING. I try to hold on to HOPE😔
The sun is about to die.
Tell this to idiot conservatives who have to be burned to actually consider climate change exists. It proves that conservatives are indeed the dumbest people on the planet who put money over the environment.  Nothing is good about the situation but my smirk aimed at the right.
"... The BIG problem with calling this stuff "" The New Normal "" is that such a glib and bloodless explanation as this will lead to acceptance ... This stuff ISN'T "" normal "" in the period of Human Civilization !
   A bit of research will reveal that the climate has not been like this since the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (about 56 million years ago), and there would be no Humans nearly that long into the future. This is NOT the work of Arsonists, unless we considered all of modern activity since the Industrial Revolution (aprox. 1760 onward) to be the arsonist, and THAT means all of us ! 
   We CAN change ... we'd BETTER change, or there wont be much of a future for our kids and our grandkids ... "
"""We are getting ontop of this problem."" 😂😂😂 A little late now. If we would have put in the effort a few decades ago we may have been able to pull this out. Now, naw, not goint going to happen no matter what new technologies come on line. There's just not enough time to get this turned around."

"People MUST vote for candidates that have climate at the top of their agenda. No other topic should matter at this point. Figure out the climate and then go back to the other issues.

The kid will hate their parents in 20 years.  Adopt if you must have a kid."
The human race has wrecked the planet in less than 300 yrs after the industrial revolution. It will only get worse as more countries increase their CO2 emissions and Brazil burns down the Amazon.

"Emissions don’t cause warming, El Niño does, check a graph produced using ALL the NOAA datapoints and you’ll find that Oceanic and Land temperatures have actually decreased slightly between 2015 and 2023… the UN, governments and corporations seem to cherry-pick a few data points to produce data they can use to manipulate populations… yes, the climate is warming at the moment but spending billions on the idiotic concept of ‘Net Zero’ whilst people struggle with cost of living and poor health services is inappropriate, despicable and borderline criminal 👎🏻😠"
Fear mongering propaganda.
You're a bunch of dumbasses
"Scientist have sat on the fence decades whilst pocketing  the vast amounts of funding Roaming the planet on jets, dinners, seminars to tell us what we already known for many decades its a modern day travesty to now say we are past the point of no return When  scientist talking on this subject was drowned out and Only background  noise remained  from those few common sense unbiased data sets driven scientist but They were drowned along with the crazy scientific data speculation from so called cranks, doom mongers who was right from the start .When in fact it was clear for all to see. We starve off the green activism to highlight this existential threat for a few more years elites drown them out too to enable the reset we are all undergoing its called transition . Now just watch the media floodgates will open no pun intended for this is no laughing matter. Just stop oil ,Greta, will be vindicated now as maars  For the few that could be bothered to read the data could see the obvious truth and so wanted to push there own message  knowing  push back would be inevitable that  it needs to stop right now . The wider populous ,societies ,nations who just want to get on with there lives and leave it to the professional to curb the habit of a life time of having a unsustainable carbon footprint  are the ones who are pocketing the vast wealth while other can only dream of having the chance to live a normal sustainable live will the future is not looking to rosy right now for many not yet born just think about that for a minute for that's all that suppose to matter to keep civilization away from a path of self destruction  So here we are just another vital issue that faces humanity survival on this planet amongst many others?"
"(I Really think our best option for our Future, is Utilizing New Nuclear energy options) Small form reactors, LFTRs, Thorium Reactors, liquid reactors. Utilizing our advanced modern technology. Improved engineering & material science. Utilizing our greater understanding of safety & designs. We have so much More advanced computer technology, robotics. It will really allow any nation to be pretty much energy independent. Less reliant on fossil fuels. They'll have efficient, stable electrical grids and the rest of the grid could experiment with alternative power sources, etc. 
We need to heal from the trauma of our past. See & learn that those things only happened solely from Us not understanding what we were doing when it came to nuclear energy. We didn't have advanced enough technology, material science, engineering, safety measures, understanding of how to go about everything, etc. This source of energy will greatly help the world improve towards the future and lowering emissions. More than anything else could, while also providing a very stable electrical grid system. Currently we have alternative energy options but the majority of our grid is powered off of fossil fuels and emission producing sources of energy. We will be so much better going forward commiting to modern advanced nuclear energy options.

So many people i know work so hard yet can barely afford the most basic cost of living..     
It baffles me. Even tho Society is struggling, We are yet to even attempt to implement a concept around: ""The better off the lowest income people are doing; The better off the rest of the economy could be doing."" -Think of it like a ecosystem in nature. The littlest things might seem insignificant yet, if they crumbled away, the entire ecosystem could crumble. The last things remaining would be the top things in the food chain.. the whales would all be gone once the plankton crumble away, the sharks would eat the whales. Then once all that's left is sharks, the sharks would eat the sharks. *(Think of this but as a analogy for our economy and our modern day society..) 

If we instead decided to support the lowest people in the ecosystem, there would be a beneficial dispersion towards other aspects of the society benefiting. All because the lowest people would be flourishing. (I say flourish but I really mean: Able to obtain the most basic living standards..) Yet even that would Vastly improve our current state of our economy & society 

*Also imagine this analogy in our economy. The more help we invest in the lowest level people, the more it would trickle into every facet of our economy. If poor people can pay their rent & not go homeless: landlords would get $, businesses would get $, banks would get $, local small shops would get $, mortgages & bills could be paid, insurance companies would get $, Taxes would get $, So essentially that $ would go out & filter right back in to improve our Country while simultaneously improving our quality of Life. Every bit of the economy would somehow find a way to benefit off of this situation... I don't get why we haven't even Given it a chance?? If it doesn't help? Then by all means stop it and figure out what else we should do.  (I hope we TRY something soon, before things get any more unstable. The worst thing we could do is continue on doing exactly what we are currently doing.)"

Not only do the CO2 emissions have to be zeroed out but the CO2 levels have to be reduced back down to 280ppm to allow the Energy to radiate back into space"

So climate wasn’t changing before the industrial revolution? I’m not claiming the climate isn’t changing I’m just saying clear cutting a forest to open pit mine the metals needed to make your battery for your Tesla isn’t the answer…
the beginning of this video gave me captain disillusion vibes lol
AUG 1883 Krakatoa explodes and Feb 1884 Newport river Ohio floods for 12 days.
It’s just not happening fast at all. Whatever you say you will never get any of us to believe it
"But from a planetary point of view we are in a low era of co2 which is several times lower than the optimal level for plant grow , which is why global greening is a thing according to NASA . Personally I think good ecology is more important than hysterical climate alarmism"
"Let me add, if science conquered histories death and misery, and reduced infant mortality from 50% to 1/5th of 1%, and antibiotics have brought the human population from 1.4B to 8 B in 120 years. These billions upon billion of lives are saved and you whine about a few hundred lost in storms? Less percent of human storm loss than before this factor of 5 by the way, in this safer world. And mother nature is the idiot? Should we go back?"
"Regarding carbon neutrality and offsets; I, an ‘Environmentalist’ and Environmental Studies major, have little trust in companies who claim carbon neutrality or offsets. Recently I rented a car through Enterprise and they offer an additional charge for Carbon Offset but due to lack of trust, i opted to not pay the additional fee. because ultimately they probably won’t follow through and it’ll just line their pockets through some scam or loophole. If there was a better way to guarantee they were actually doing what they claim, I would opt in."
Im not even going to watch the video. The thumbnail says it all. Climate change didn't happen before humans huh? I guess that puts the crap evolution theory to bed.
Yeah that's great and all but people kind of muck up this entire climate change message by going around the world in their private jets preaching to people about it.. maybe if that didn't happen people will take it more seriously who knows
"There is NO evidence that co2 causes global warming, scientists cant even agree if the world is getting warmer or colder."
This video really doesn't sound like you. I unsubscribe disappointed
"All this Bll sht energy in the system is nonsense, let me know when night time freezing stops working and I might listen."
When you consider the complete population of humans on the planet could fit into a tiny country the size of Palestine and we are supposed to believe we have altered the planet in such a significant way I simply don't buy it and neither should you. Like with a lot of these crazy claims I sometimes feel like the little boy in 'The emperors new clothes'
My frozen windows debunk everything.
"I mean, there is going to be another ice age in 50K years and in about 600M years the sun will reach a temperature that makes sustaining life on Earth impossible..Earth isn't a ""forever"" home regardless. For two decades civilians were pummeled with ozone layer fear mongering. If asked now, talking heads say that the world governments and big corporations got together to fix the ozone layer issue, civilians had nothing to do with fixing it."
"I did not watch the video to the end, because it simply just standard narrative of ""man made climate change"", which I could careless about.  What I want to know is the following; how establish is climate science that we can accept its conclusions from it a face value?  Are there scientists who do not agree with the current argument of man made climate change?  What predictions from our current understanding that proves climate change is man made?  And what current climate models are there, and how accurate have they been?"
Climate scientist Judith Curry did a great explanation as to why so many scientists or so-called scientists have to say that there's a climate crisis.   If they don't agree with those pushing the green agenda they don't get funding that includes NASA and NOAA for both been caught messing with the numbers. Auto is only supplied 2% of greenhouse gases. Volcanic cycles change the temperature and we've been in one for the last couple of years. The Earth has had extreme heat and extreme cold worse than what they've been saying.  Some of the worst floods in California occurred in the 1800s long before the industrial revolution. The biggest lie is that we should get rid of all carbon dioxide. That is what plants and the ecosystem depend on. Those that are pushing this know that the more they get rid of carbon famine will occur. And the earth is fully capable of cleaning itself which has been proven also.
"I love these shows, but you end up hurting the number of people you reach by touching on subjects outside the scope that involves politics. Mentioning trickle-down economics probably turned off some potential viewers.

"If he wasn't so clearly politically motivated and ignorant about the terminology from the start, it could hsve been interesting to hear how he would refute some of the claims he mentions. Don't believe the name of this YouTube channel, be smart!"
"But the Fact Remains that even if we stopped all pollution and ceased all human activity that produces green house gases, sea levels would still rise and the world would still be getting warmer. Short of inventing some sort of way of controling the weather there's very little we can do... . I'm not saying that humans don't have an effect on the climate ( that much seems obvious) but to expect people to stop using their cars or demand that developing countries cease their industrial activities seems callous and wrong (it almost seems like an excuse for first world countries to keep others in poverty)"
"You're really pushing this?
...and unsubscribed."
"This video was very long and was guilty of much of the same conjecture found in arguments against climate change. Hence the narrator offered many arguments based on a leap of faith. No statistics to back claims of CO2 emitted from humans exceed that of volcanos. In addition, glossing over the mere fact that recorded temps of the earth started in the 1850s. (Leap of faith from a small sample). Then there is Mars...?? The elephant in the room. We are just supposed to take him at his word that the Milankovitch Cycles are simply too insignificant to make a difference as they did in the past ice ages. The biggest mistake the narrator makes is his assumption of the people who question this new climate science, are science deniers. Instead it is clearly a rush to judgement by him based on assumption. Lest we forget the Donner Party rush to judgement to take the cutoff that sealed their fate. I'm not saying that all arguments he presented are lacking facts. I'm just suggesting that the basis of science is to question everything. Included are past accepted theories. Newton's theory of gravity was overturned by Einstein's... Instead of making insinuations, continue with the evidence. Science will be able to stand up on its own."
"I think that most people (in the United States) just can't really fathom how many people there are on earth or how much energy is required to maintain our (US citizen's) current standard of living.

It's the same reason we can't fathom how having 4 dozen billionaires is decreasing the amount of currency in circulation, which drives up the cost of living, regardless of whether wages go up or not."
"Lol you could just retitle this video to ""climate copium""."
"Very good video on the many variables affecting energy/heat exchange in/out of atmosphere.  Which of coarse as moderator explains is “modeled by scientist”.  Here is a question I can’t find answer for…. If models are so sophisticated and should be “good”, then why are all significantly higher than actual temps of past 30 years?  Love for the PBS moderator to get into the models, and tell us what has the models gotten wrong and how are they being adjusted to be more accurate.  Bottom line if models are so good, why aren’t they “ACTUAL-ly” good?"
"I myself is cringing at you're effort to give false climate temps which actually have cooled over the past 4 decades Sir.... Check the UN climate report it's all there. You are correct with to the minute theories. A higher C02 will be beneficial, more fresh water more vegetation which will be beneficial to the earth as a hole. Just on my research over the past 25 years. Cheers. Nothing wrong with the models, it's the inputs that are misrepresented thus the modelling will never be true!! And no it's not a belief I too read and work on facts. Cheers......"
"Don't worry, project climate fear is in full effect. Pretty soon no one will be allowed to own a petrol car, we will have to buy a 3 times as heavy car that isn't recyclable, and still gets it's energy from 95% coal, gets kids to work in horrible conditions and risk their lives, while polluting their African rivers, all while paying a huge ""pay per mile"" fee because of the warmer temperature, even though the UK is having a very cool, wet summer right now. at least we will give our remainder of out pay check from the recession and high energy bills to the government, which will somehow make the problem be fixed.
SMH. You people are insane. You either can't see how you are being played, or are part of the scam."
"Remember back in the 1970s when we were all warned there would be an Ice Age by 2000?  Yeah, how did that turn out?  Climate change does happen and there are human impacts on it, but the extremism helps no one, especially when those pushing it hardest are both the worst offenders and greatest beneficiaries since they're often investing in the questionable technologies they favor."
So what is the solution to eliminating or reducing our effect on the climate? Most of the proposed solutions offer a cure that is worse than the disease.  I want over the entire ipcc report but not the newest one
"Humans are natural too, So climate change is ALWAYS natural. And the climate always changes  Are we, causing or not causing this, not part of nature then? Are we above nature? Are we bad, sinners, selfish? Isn't that exactly what the church and now 'political science' has been telling us?"

Who knew that big body of water that covers 3/4th of the surface of earth is so helpful in absorbing and containing 91% of all of that extra heat. Coral bleaching anyone? i rather have that than all land being on fire!..Hope we fix it soon. Can those new Heat Batteries become a solution?? --Really enjoyed the educational video on the state of the world.
All you got to talk about is Carbon Dioxyde? You're not talking about the other chemicals that matter more for greenhouse as well as the fact the ocean absorbs excess CO2 combined with there being heavy CO2 levels in the past.
Number 1 problem with this video is the theories are completely inconsistent.
"One may be repelled by this law of nature which demands that all living things should mutually devour one another. The fly is snapped up by a dragon-fly, which itself is swallowed by a bird, which itself falls victim to a larger bird. This last, as it grows old, becomes a prey to microbes, which end by getting the better of it. These microbes, in their turn, find their predestined ends."
Climate change is to do with the Russian invasion 😅
"It’s very politicized, and numbers have been caught being fudged"
"If human weren’t present would there be this big hoopla about the natural occurrence of climate change. If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around, does it still make a sound. Enough of the fest mongering."
Human action is really important.
I do have a weird view differ than the rest. Climate change is natural. But advance civilizations also contribute to it. It wouldn't mean the end of the world. It just mean a major change to that civilization. Will it cause the fall of said civilization? yes. Will it advance it? Yes. And we human have the tendency to only run when water reach our feet.
I think we're on track to solve global warming soon. Nuclear winter is still looking 👌. But on a real note i think we can block light if we work on it... also don't plants like it. Feal bad for the bugs tho.

"We are coming out of an ice age. What do you think would naturally occur after an ice age? Warming of course. 
Do humans add to it? Certainly, but you smack the climate in one direction it will just swing back hard in the other. Paying tax and using ""green"" solutions does not solve this non-problem. The earths balance will be maintained long after we wipe ourselves out."
"Any study on earth magnetic fields?
Why it’s reducing? or it’s fake news ?
If yes 
How human effecting the same ? Or not !!

Do the reduction of magnetic field of earth effect our climate and our health ?"
It's this simple. This earth is like a motor in a car. It's cooled with oil and water. When a motor runs low on oil or water what happens? It runs hot! The center of this earth has a ball of fire in it that is hot as the sun. If the earth is depleted of it's oil which they are doing on a daily basis what's going to happen? It's simple! It's going to get hotter. That's all you need to know! It's not complicated. Stop the digging of oil. The sun is our main source of energy! Peace
"Quite conveniently you didn’t include numbers. We are being hit by 1361 W/m2. A 1000 W/m2 hits surface. Co2 absorbs 1,8 W/m2. IR reflects back from the atmosphere above 300W/m2. If we double CO2 it will absorb 3,4W/m2. 0.1% change in Earth’s albedo is 1,63W/m2. Tell all as it is and let people decide"
Is this comedy!?
"But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.  The problem with this statement is that it is false. Going back to the Bronze age we find global temperatures were higher than today.  Climate change occurred and caused the Bronze Age collapse. 800 AD we see again Temperatures rise causing a draught  that lasted 400 years. This is one of the caused of the Collapse of the Maya Empire. All these changes occurred before Mankind started to use Fossil Fuels. To understand climate change you need to look at the Orbit of the earth.   I remember in the1970's when scientist warned us of Global Cooling."

How the Tonga Volcano Eruption will Cool the Earth
Saturday January 15th at 5:15 pm local time a volcano on the island of Hunga Tonga erupted sending a 5 km wide cloud of ash 20 km into the atmosphere. Loud explosions could be heard on islands up to 65 km away. From space, the erupting column of smoke and even atmospheric shockwaves were captured propagating across the Pacific Ocean. The eruption started a magnitude 5.8 earthquake and a tsunami that reached as far as the United States. Although by the time it got there waves were limited to only about 4 feet. But the Tonga explosion will have far more reaching consequences than what’s happened in the immediate aftermath. 

Preliminary observations showed that the eruption ejected a large amount of volcanic material into the stratosphere. Enough to cool the Earth, and at least temporarily, reverse man-made climate change in an event known as volcanic winter. Get ready for some extreme ice storms over the next few years, and if you live in Florida, you might want to buy your snow parkas now.

If you like the video check out our video on how scientists hope to mimic volcanic winter and cool the earth by injecting SO2 high into the earth's atmosphere:   

 • The Crazy Plan to Fight Climate Chang..."
"The worst myth has to be that climate change deniers are ""skeptics."""
Climate change IS natural... We've just sped it up to a dangerous degree.
"we need this Mostly Man Made Climate change to keep producing that excessive water. California never has enough water to satisfy every Farmer that helps our cities grow bigger and bigger, there is always some arguments about whether the fish get the water or the farmers get more water, what about the movie star swimming pools cant leave these people hanging after they made investments, we need this Mostly Man Made Climate change to keep producing that excessive water."
Could Humans it self also help with how much more our planet is heating up?.
"What came first the chicken or the egg, what came first the Volcano or the Climate, what came first the salamander or the lizard, what came first the frog or the rabbit, point is everything is Nature not UnNature all. Does a single cell make eggs."
"i dont agree, is your average chart of increasing temperature a global average? or are you picking particular areas that fit your argument. if you take the united states for example, 1940's had the same thermometers and recorded temperatures higher record temperatures than compared to today. is our average temperature higher? if so why arent our record temperatures higher? you compare the united states emitting more co2 than volcanos with just a few states. why not mention china instead which does astronomical amounts more than the united states and is not pushing a climate control agenda at all? video seems like cherry picked data to me to fit your argument, but thats just my opinion and i could be wrong"
Volcanic C02 should not be paid for by forcing people to eat crickets.  Submarines bail when the C02 level reaches ~5000 ppm.  The ISS bails around 7000 ppm.  Planets - as a mater of fact grow best around 1000-1200 ppm and at that level they grow better and use less water.  Gee - if the ocean is so hot - why is the Arctic ice pack grown every year since 2012?  Check out the glacier in Greenland which also has been growing.  You most likely know that any global model is basically = “Garbage In = Garbage Out”. You climate model can be used to model ANY outcome desired.   In 1902 or so - world headlines said the glaciers in Alaska would be gone in just a few years - yea - they are still there.  Science is not by consensus- how cares what survey says?  Humans existed in 1902 - and again in the 1930’s dust bowl years - show that in your model.  In 1975 the headline in Time magazine was the climate cooling was going to make it so we could not feed ourselves.  Typically then - the “data” is picked to start around 1979 - to avoid trying to show what happened in the mid 70’s period.
"No proof, it is Indeed caused by humans. Lots of evidence says the climate changes naturally. Only a theory that humans cause it."
"I subscribed but since watching the videos, I just feel dumberer"
"It’s completely stupid to claim that Ice-ages isn’t a natural occurrence due to fluctuation of both gasses and the positioning of the earth around the sun… 

Climate change also happens with involvement of the moon and the tides of the oceans. 

If you think this guy is actually smart enough to promote politically motivated changes. 

Science doesn’t agree with what Joe or you claiming. 

We already made calculations and scientific study of factoring in people and the actual vehicles and factories and everything humans touch. Scientists calculated the amounts of metric tons of gasses every year. We even calculated such estimates from as far back as the 1700s. 

Meanwhile scientist proven human involvement has very little to nill in effect on the environment 

What’s happening is more of a cycle that been happening and like most calculations we haven’t studied all the correlation of all the patterns occurring In history. 

The guy claiming that it’s like economics or trickle down economic effects is absolutely wrong. You can make a broad claim of that such degree is dishonest. 
He doesn’t mention any metrics no histograms and no form of averages on the situation.

Volcanoes on surface level do cause cooling but with straight short periods that can last around 2 decades of heat and over 75+% of volcanos are under water which 
Actually causes the opposite of the effect of volcanoes on the surface.

Also claiming that humans admit more carbon admission than volcanoes is factually just wrong scientist studies actually prove  the opposite."
"The problem with declaring that it can not be natural is that you have to insist that nature stop having any effect what so ever when man decided to take over the weather.

The only evidence that this is not natural is based on a theory that the earth was cooling over the last 1000 years and that is wrong."
😭
The earth is in one it’s coolest periods.  Climate change IS natural 😂😂😂. We are closer to the coldest earth temp than the warmest.
"What factors cause the Inconsistent rain and snow in California, is it the constant man made pollution Or  is it the Inconsistent nature of Volcanoes, the Coriolis affect states that the Earth and Hurricanes will always spin the same direction no matter how much the Earth Tilts. Some people are El Nino enthusiasts but that seems to be inconsistent theory also?"
How's your ESG score?
Be smart! 😗😙😋😃😅😂🤣 when you believe anything an supposed expert say you’re not really smart.
"After coal is burnt how much does it weigh, after a volcano how much does all of its material weigh.even if you try to assign values they cant possibly accurate, the two actions are not the same in any sense."
"One of the things that bugs me, is that apparently ONLY the US causes climate change.  So the US MUST wreck its economy so that all the other nations can continue to use all the oil they want any way they want without any attempt to reduce emissions.  The last time I checked, the environment in China, India and Russia was a disaster, but apparently still doesn't affect the global climate.  After all, emissions from other nations don't affect the climate.  Also flying around in private jets doesn't seem to affect the climate either.  Also, rising sea levels don't affect rich people's residences and vacation homes - they will only affect poor people.  I'm not sure how rising sea levels are going to selectively affect only poor people, but you can be sure that is what will happen.  By poor people, I mean folks that are upper middle class and lower."
"Many of those who post those cynical claims about climate change being natural are paid trolls directed to threads by arms of the fossil fuel industry. I know because as a professional writer nearing retirement, I get offers to become one of them, under the guise of doing ""public relations writing.""
Many deniers also are people with 401K retirement accounts whose retirement planners may be telling them will pay them less in their golden years if oil, coal, and auto company stocks drop. The end of strong pensions is clearly what causes this problem. Retirements are uncertain and people fear plans will collapse."
Bs.
"People are a part of nature, not something detatched from it. So yes, something made by humans is natural."
Today the sea is too warm.
"Humans are natural, so what we make is natural, thus climate change is natural. ;-)

Let's stop making it though, not all that is natural is good for us, I particularly don't want any cancer, natural or otherwise."

"Fact 1: Remove the Earth’s atmosphere or even just the GreenHouse Gases and the Earth becomes much like the Moon, no water vapor or clouds, no ice or snow, no oceans, no vegetation, no 30% albedo becoming a barren rock ball, hot^3 (400 K) on the lit side, cold^3 (100 K) on the dark. At our distance from the Sun space is hot (394 K) not cold (5 K). 
That’s NOT what the Radiative GreenHouse Effect theory says.
EVIDENCE:
RGHE theory “288 K w – 255 K w/o = a 33 C colder ice ball Earth” 255 K assumes w/o keeps 30% albedo, an assumption akin to criminal fraud.

Fact 2: The GHGs require “extra” energy upwelling from a surface radiating as a black body.
EVIDENCE:
According to the K-T atmospheric power flux balance, numerous clones and SURFRAD the GHGs must absorb an “extra” 396/333/63 W/m^2 LWIR energy upwelling from the surface allegedly radiating as a black body. These graphics contain egregious arithmetic and thermodynamic errors. See https://youtu.be/0Jijw7-YG-U

Fact 3: Because of the significant non-radiative, i.e. kinetic, heat transfer processes of the contiguous participating atmospheric molecules the surface cannot upwell “extra” energy as a black body. 
EVIDENCE:
As demonstrated by experiment, the gold standard of classical science.

CONCLUSION:
No RGHE, no GHG warming, no CAGW or mankind/CO2 driven climate change."

"there is no climate crisis, just a bunch of people trying to make money of a made up Climate crisis, JUST LIKE YOU IN THIS VIDEO"
"The first graph shown of global temperature change between 1880-2020 has a modified y-axis (Video: 3:02). Above 0 degrees, each unit above 0 degC is in 0.5 unit increments, whereas below 0 degC, 1 unit increment is -1.5 degrees Celsius. Therefore the graph does not allow for fair visual comparison of temperature change over that time period. 

So looking at the numbers:

Between around ~1910 to ~1943 there is a temperature change from (approximately) -1.4 degC to +0.25 degC, a temperature change of nearly 1.7 degC! 

In the video he claims the temperature change in the second half of the 20th century to today is unprecedented (temperature change of approx 0.0 degC to approx 1.0 degC ie temperature change of 1.0 degC).

I deal with climate change in my field of work, I fully believe that man made causes are driving climate change and are having negative consequences all around the world - however, climate deniers are not stupid people - information given, like in this video, is very simplified. Presenting graphs like the one discussed only adds fuel to the clime denial fire...  

Also just noticed - between 1880-1910, temperature changes from approx. 0.0 degC to -1.5 degC, never thought about this before. What could have caused it? Or are small temperature fluctuations possibly more normal than we think?"
"This is a great video, but where are the sources? I want to show this to climate denialists but the first thing they'll say is that it was all made up because there no sources linked in the description."
"Why would you focus on grand statements like ""the climate is changing"" Duh-doy! Focus on the negative aspects of human-centred change like global warming. Climate change is natural but it is also affected by human interaction, specifically pollution, etc."
"Great video Kurzgesagt, but you guys put the wrong map for Nigeria, i expected high quality review before release of the video."

"Fake news

...

this is not.

Have you ever thought of doing a collection of studies with appendices with visualtions like those in ""Knowledge is Beautiful""?"
"In a nutshell, at the end of the video you say ""everyone needs to do what they can.""  I was a little disappointed that you didn't recommended any specific action.  It would be great to have another video that breaks down an individuals carbon omissions and what action that individuals can take to reduce those emissions.  Also what action those individual can take to help other reduce there emissions."
"Don't kid yourselves, it's already too late, check the UN's latest climate report. Even if we went to 0 carbon output right now it wont fix what's happening, we have already gone past the 2 degree calculus rise that was predicted to be the catastrophic point that was predicted in the 80's. 
Remember the effects of climate change come 20 years AFTER the cause so changing now wont stop us creeping up in temperature over the next 2 decades. 

We're f'cked and changing now would be like trying to put out the fire AFTER your house has burned to the ground.
Now the only smart thing to do to survive is to prepare for the clusterf'ck that is going to be the next 50 years of disasters that constantly hit (mainly the developing world) causing them to become increasingly desperate & by extension far more hostile. 

I personally keep a year's worth of dried & storable food as well as a good supply of ethanol burner fuel (because its burned fumes are just water vapor). Sh't is going to hit the fan this decade & i'm not going to be one of the idiots dying in the first wave."

Build enough nuclear to get rid of fossils. For some reason people don't seem to want this so I assume they don't really give a fuck about the planet.
"The problem is, even getting rid of a fraction of their emissions is so expensive that not even the developed countries can afford it. We are facing the worlds biggest recession, the trillions of dollars that would be needed aren't there.
Imho we can try, and we should try, but with todays technologies, we will fail. Better get those fusion reactors up and running fast..."
@4:09 you are showing the flag of Iran instead of India 😑

Great Video! keep it up.
"I haven’t finished the video yet....
But get ready for the sh*t show in the comments people!!"
"Trying to slice it this way and that way with your averages highlights the agenda. Trying to base a countries CO2 emissions holistically with the past does nothing for the future.

"The way to stop climate change is to buy local and try produce your own environmentally friendly food, you can't blame western nations for the lax laws in china when you still buy that shit. The idea of historical emissions is also ridiculous as the video fails to account the empires that existed during the industrial age and what lands were aided by the new tech. Right now the west accounts for a ridiculous amount of responsibility in the climate change issue with frankly stupid laws suffocating nations and their people leading to resentment. Environment issues are a rich person's problem if you want people to get on board with solving the climate change issue you can't just cover up all the other issues."
Am I the only feeling like a monster for this ?
"Thanks for associating with one of top 5 private company in order to criticize the action of public administrations.

Don't forget that history is judging us in all our choices."
"Whilst this may be controversial, I think that climate change will not be tackled properly until 1. Education on the subject is expanded in all countries and 2. Developed countries reduce their lifestyle emissions to pay for a green development for developing countries."
"No one needs to ""fix"" our improving climate."
They both are to blame!
Why does carbon dioxide just reflect the heat back to earth and not back out into space?
"""clean energy"" only becomes cheaper because there is abundant (fossil) energy elsewhere to help mine, transform and transport materials between countries. There is no such thing as cheap clean energy. If wind turbines and solar panels were only produced thanks to renewable energy, the prices of finished goods would be considerably more expensive. Another thing, is that it is delusional to think about reaching 0 carbon emission keeping all the comfort we have today, to be rational that would mean no planes at all, people basically travelling only a few kilometers every year, small wardrobes, eating barely no meat, heating houses at 15°c or so in winter, and possibly the end of mass video streaming (sadly for this channel). to name a few... Not really sure this is gonna happen in the years to come...

"Screw Bill Gates, but this stuff does need to get out. Thank you"
"This video was very irresponsible and the historical analysis is so one-dimensional and incorrect. And I suspect the sponsors are involved in the final message of blaming China. 
Any correct and decent historical analysis would include colonialism, US imperialism, and the global supply chain. For instance, the United States has over 800 military bases all over the world to 1) maintain access to the resources and raw materials it needs for the production of its goods, therefore, to build its wealth, and 2) to protect US investments and productive forces that produce for US businesses abroad. So real and historically correct analysis should include questions like: how many of these countries' emissions are a direct result of historical and ongoing colonialism or historical and ongoing military interventions that keep countries producing goods that are made for Western businesses? The West polices, threatens, and forces these countries to produce their goods and to maintain access to their raw materials. You cannot blame countries for their emissions if they are forced to emit them under threat of a gun, and moreover, I'd even argue that they shouldn't even be counted as emission by those countries, and should be counted under the country for which they are producing their goods. 
So more accurately, the question should be, ""how much do these countries AND their militarily imposed business interests abroad emit? 
  
Why was China able to industrialize and become the worlds largest producer of goods, which made them the #1 polluter? Their factories and manufacturing economy didn't just pop up out of nowhere. Seriously, what countries are they producing goods for? You analysis is one dimensional because Chinese factories are largely given raw materials from African and Latin American countries that are forced by Western militaries to keep the raw materials flowing outward--which the process of mining and refining these raw materials are likely counted in your numbers under the countries from which they come, and not counted under the countries that force this production. Then once these goods reach China, they are made for Western businesses and Western demand in general. 
This video is borderline red baiting and completely whitewashing of history and you should be ashamed for releasing something so obviously in line with the type of thinking that only benefits the US state department and the West in general by absolving them of their historical and ongoing crimes of colonialism, militarism, and slavery and other forms of forced labor!"

"Bill Gates, like every other billionaire, has zero real interest in the climate crisis. If he did, he wouldn't be dodging taxes (which could go to renuable energy investment and ecological projects), exploiting the southern hemisphere for resources (which perpetuates poverty in those regions and destroys local ecology) or hoarding profits by underpaying staff (because those struggling to get by will never have funds or time to invest in addressing the issues). Glad this video highlighted how the wealthy (aka capitalism) are to blame, but as long as it's being bankrolled by the wealthy, they can never actually call out our economic system for playing the massive part it does. Capitalism burns or we all do."

"Not to sound rude Kurzgesagt but Irelands carbon per capita is a worrying amount, we only have 5 million people yet make around 13 tons of carbon dioxide a year.
We're also the one of the most fossil fuel dependant countries at 85.35%."

Im sorry. Since he and his WHO are responsible for the deaths of thousands, why listen to him?"
we all are and we need to work together one and all.
"Individual responsibility and accountability. No person, company, country should be free from scrutiny.
Cruise ships banned. Frequent international travel for pleasure banned. Living in a climate too hot for comfort with air conditioning but not putting effort into smart structure design to harness the elements. Over producing to meet imaginary demand banned.
We make way too much crap for no good reason. Companies make things and dump them and write them off. Whole buildings are abandoned with no plans to recycle them.
We couldn't maintain this lifestyle when there was half the population and it is forecast to go up 50% in the next thirty years.
All the infrastructure we put up over the last hundred years is starting to fail. How are we going to deal with that without doubling down on the emissions which built them?

"Geo engineering is the cause of climate change.
Look up weather generator or David miles extreme weather mitigation.
Also though, we do have a pole shift underway. North pole is travelling across to Siberia.

It was all bull and has been created to demonize the public as the cause, but it's large companies and governments creating it to tax and control the people.

Why are the consequences of climate change bad?
"Who emitted the most in total is really irrelevant. Those that emit the most now need to cut the most now.

Besides, china has emitted half of what the US has emitted in total, in a far shorter timespan. That is a problem."
CAN WE ELIMINATE CHINA FROM THIS BIG WORLD?
"Good news the eu is going to put a requirement on the label of green investment, meaning non green investments won’t be able to claim they are and become les valuable. If this like the energy label spreads to the rest of the world (it most likely will since you can’t really ignore the second biggest trade block) this will heavily reduce emissions and greatly speed up decarbonisation."
I thought India would have been more than 7%
"The climate is on a cycle that depends primarily on the shape of the Earth’s orbit and the tilt of its axis. So, no one is responsible for climate change. It has been exacerbated to the point where the timing of the next ice age may have been effected, but the underlying change itself is part of a regular process. Regardless of climate change, we need to protect the environment because it is the only one we have."

"Great video, as always! One other thing worth mentioning is that the West isn’t independent from Chinese emissions; deindustrialised nations (I.e. the UK) rely only Chinese goods and services so still bear responsibility for the emissions they produce!

Im not surprised on sudden change of temperature 🙂
This just in- summer is the hottest season of the year. Who knew?
Hello!!
Bring back the apocalypse

i made ice to stop climate change
Pro tip:Stop driving if you can
How's that new?
They tried 2 tell us 20 years ago did we listen
Or it’s just hot
Second comment
Propaganda is a hellva drug
"When it's hot as hell, I turn on my sprinklers and play in my trampoline. Does the trick!"
See KUWAIT 🇰🇼
"I'm all for the extinction of humans, we've failed miserably at being steward's of this beautiful planet and each other. Time to hit the reset button and let mother nature try again in a few million years after Gaia has repaired the damage we've done."
So its not Japan hottest Heatwave....
"so thats why it was so warm in schwyz, switzerland."
And then we have these people who don't believe in climate change. How can you not admit it exists.
"wake up people, the climate of the earth changes. It's been doing so long before the human race began and will continue to do so once we're gone"
"Yeah limit fossil fuels direct to consumer, but supply the electric charging stations with the same amount of fossil fuel, its not a scheme 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
But I've realised its been hotter in my area
Heatwaves been fakin' me out... Can't make them happier now
"There's a typo. You need to take out the ""may be"" in your title."
Climate Hoax
The bombs cause climate change not your car
"""Summer Heatwaves May Be Due to Climate Change"" Wow I would've never guessed"
"Whoever's reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen"
True
FAKE NEWS
Climate change in an inconceivable issue. Our politicians need to be taking climate change seriously!
That is why it is so hot in Japan
Propaganda.
Man...
I wish we had it warmer here in Canada I did use my A/C 2 times little bit this year
Where I'm from the heat is normal but it does generate a very strong hurricane🤔
“May be due to climate change…” really? Stop playing dumb with your viewers.
May be? No definitely.
End of the world
What don’t you put out how they manipulate the weather? Show how the government does that?
I'm just saying here and don't take it seriously but we should counter climate change with nuclear winter.
"Summer hot, winter cold. So 150 years ago Japan was as hot as it is now? So it has been cooler for 150 years?"
We’re all literally doomed…
climate change doesnt exist. fake news
"So,, climate change or,,, 50 yrs of industrial pollution,.. eh ,, maybe 6000 or so experimental nuclear tests,,, tough one there!"
Is summer is supposed to be hot 😂
"If people would read the new testament maybe they would really know what's going on in the world, but you must have a love for Truth"
Scientists have been warning us about this for decades! Instead of wars etc. We all need to come together as a whole to treat our planet better. Mother nature never loses!! Much love to everyone

It’s no climate change it’s tropical heat being pulled north by a low pressure
"I'm spreading laugh through meme and fail videos. If you don't mind passing by for some laughter

You need something I can never give

You can't fight it
You can't breathe
You say something so loving, but
Now I've got to let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Its warm
Remember this is the coldest summer youll ever have again!
Not the climate yet the Sun and H.A.R.P.  Maybe those talking about changing the world should run water pipelines instead of blaming the poor that you tax to death.
"some reason, for me in cali it isnt that hot as on may and june"
Or probably it could just be a regular heatwave.. 🤷
"Inside edition get rid of that ""may"" out of your title because it is 100% because of climate change."
Welp........a little late for that.
"What happened to global
Cooling???? Then global warming?  Now climate change?  Hmmmm"
"If the climate was an embryo or a fetus, Republicans would be going crazy about saving it."
This is making sense the bible says that there will be global change and conflict which meaning its near the end
During this time India used to heatwaves in different states but monsoon arrived at right time with rain
I love heat waves that stop people from living longer.
UK be like: 😑 what
Can inside edition confidently or dogmatically say “climate change” is responsible for hot temperatures? Or is climate change a misleading term one can use whenever climate actually changes.
Oh WOW breaking NeWSZ
"""summer heatwaves may be due to climate change""
😮😲 No way!! I never would have guessed"
Uhh that's what I assumed it was this whole time??
You wouldn’t say?🤣

It's HAARP!
"Can we all agree that when They upload our

Well Los Angeles is at 76° so I'm kind good... i guess
For sure
"One of my family members who is collage educated, Does not believe in climate change, They say Ignorance is bliss, He must be IGNORANT!!! AND BLISSFUL  🤣"
"May, it is 🥴
It’s only gonna get worse"
Or it “may” not be because heat waves were happening before humans existed
If you look down my street you see heat waves and many wild fires happen
"Bear Tooth Highway in Montana opened late this year due to massive, late, heavy snows. The Colorado ski season lasted into May this year, the longest ski season on record. Just sayin', don't believe everything the news tells you. They leave out stuff that doesn't support the global warming/climate change agenda."
It’s hot. Good thing it isn’t winter time. Or I’d be worried.

well.. yeah. we've been hearing about how this will happen for over 20 years. probably too late now. it's already begun

Nothing but a scam...  these con artists are creating rules and regulations to problems that dont exist so they can get funding and line their pockets... thats all it is.
"mike are you crazy, we havent had winter in 6 years in the northeast"
Blah! Blah! Blah!
LOL!  Should have the summit in Moscow.
This is Globalist Propaganda pure and simple.  STOP IT!
"If you believe this 🦬💩, I have some magic beans I'll sell you"
I wonder how treehuggers will convince Putin and Xi (after they destroy USA in the future war) to care about switching away from fossil fuels?
I hate these read-only style videos. Can we get audio back please?
"So China signed this with the caveat that they can continue to develop coal as a fuel?? And Norway? And who else has a caveat that starts with: but we need ...

Amazing that these delegates have not read the early history of the very large "" environmental industry and the mis- information propagated as science at the roots of it! This is a bad joke!!"
7 year covenant sounds very suspicious 🤨 Jesus is coming soon! Hallelujah!
How is it  historic when they already have plans of a fourth industrial revolution? Seems to me they are just following the herd.
Here we go again with the science fiction drama. what a scam!! what would happen if earth gets over populate? start to kill people? part of the climate change agenda..
Dont remember these SOBs being on a ballot anywhere. Why is some summit somewhere telling me what I must do? This is international socialism. It will fail.
and then they all got on their private jets to go home....
Co2 is great and plants like it
"Under the U.N.’s and John Kerry’s leadership, CO2 emissions and atmospheric levels have increased in spite of Covid lockdowns.  The Netherlands and Argentina have just elected leaders who think this is all bullshit, and China and India are increasing their use of coal, by a lot.  Kerry is living the dream of a narcissist but the Botox is wearing off."
Wonder what happens when we are all looking out of our caves in 2050 and the temperature hasn't risen 1.5 degrees C.  What then?
😂😂😂
It's about government control
"And who is going to enforce this when China, Russia, and other communist and corrupt contries refuse?  Its a joke."
Money scam
So the people with oil are going to stop drilling? No. They will keep using and let the west bankrupt themselves
Tired of these nobodies
i say we transition these criminals (that are rich off our taxed labor) to the big house
"The Climate Nazi's are a grsve threat to mankind and freedom everywhere, stop believing the Deep State lies"
The transition will take place after the last drop of oil is sold.
"Climate change is mostlycaused by SOLAR FLARES AND HAS BEEN PROVED ""SCIENTIFICALLY""!!!"
That agreement isn't worth the paper it's written on.
"Nothing historic here. Just more blah, blah, blah. The foxes are running the hen house."
"So... to summarize, we met to discuss global warming in the stronghold of oil. and decided to decrease COAL to eliminate emissions. Where we gonna charge the electric cars with? ahhh.... Dubai's oil, which, in 25 years, will be expensive and gas stations will all be flying middle east flags."

"This proposal is bunch of bullshit.

The climate change wackos have been screaming their nonsense for over 50 years and nothing they have predicted has ever come true. There are a lot of people becoming rich (some becoming millionaires) from gullible fools giving their money to bullshit climate change causes and groups. The earth has survived ice ages, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, hurricanes and even an asteroid hit that killed over 80% of all life on the planet. Nothing man is doing is causing a climate crisis.

I just watched this video and just can not believe to stupidity of those who wrote it. Wash repeat and wash again. They said the same exact thing in late 1960s and 70s. Movies were made about it such as Soylent Green. Right now we have the lowest CO2 levels in the history of this planet. Yes there is climate change which is 100% normal but THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR THE PREMISE PUT OUT IN THIS SCIENCE FICTION VIDEO!

"The retail sales for this holiday season will prove that the public demands the acceleration of global warming.  
  Faux environmentalist will expose themselves to be frauds as they dine on subsidized meat/dairy/eggs. And after they give and receive their modern trinket gifts, they will go back to saying, “Stop global warming”. 
  The rich who Mine/Manufacture will rejoice this fiscal quarter, with pockets freshly lined with the money from the shopaholic society. 
  Rinse and repeat. Until Thwaites glacier finally falls and the first blue ocean event rears its ugly head and becomes the norm. 
  Government officials hands have been tied by the shopaholics, who demand jobs in selling and manufacturing modern trinkets from mining what’s left of the planet. Short term GDP growth trumps any legislation for de-growth. 
  A planet’s biosphere was fractured by a bunch of shopaholics. The habitability for 90+% of species will cease due to humanities obsession to destroy."

"Me personally, don't think that would ever happen. See, in the beginning, God created  Heaven and Earth. Earth is perfectly created to heal itself, the man hadn't been created yet. When everybody around the world were not around and about during covid-19, in that little time Earth had a break from humans, Earth started healing and a lot of places came back to life, even animals were coming out of hiding. Until man came back out into the picture. Now everything is dying again. This place is gonna get worse because of man. maybe inhabitable where ever humans are. But Earth will come back to life, because it was created to live for ever. Earth ís a living creation, is alive. Ask any scientist, I'm pretty sure he'll agree with me. He might not believe in God, but can't deny that Earth is a living organism. Watch those regions on Earth where human are not present.They are beautiful and full of life vs those places where humans live. We really don't appreciate this beautiful place that was created specially for all us. Even the Ozone layer repaìred itself during covid. God's will, will prevale over men's. No matter what we do. 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
I commend you on being real.   Mother Nature  has been beat up and walked over.  Not only have humans trashed Planet Earth.  It's very polluted in our immediate Space.  Ah well --  make more babies and consume more.   Keep Corporate World going.   Bye............

"One of my pet peeves...when you show videos of industrial sites with smokestacks, you are pushing misinformation if those smokestacks are emitting something that is pure white which then largely disappears very shortly after leaving the stack. THAT IS STEAM. It is water vapor. Unless we are now categorizing steam as a pollutant, you are giving people a false picture. We can be brutally honest about industrial pollution without giving people the false impression that if they see steam coming out of something their air is being polluted by it. Show vehicles belching out smoke with a color. Show smokestacks belching out smoke with a color. Such video exists."

There are very many false and incorrect statements in this video. Just one example is the statement that there is widespread deforestation. This false. The fact is that forests have increased significantly in much of the world over the past 40 years satellite images prove this. This video is nothing more than alarmist propaganda.

Why is none ever taking into considerations that Earth's climate was never stable. Climate have been going from freezing to hot back and forth. Some less heard people also point out there are more greenery than before due to higher CO2 and plants will die out with low CO2 etc. We are now most likely in warmer period in between ice ages.
"The thing they don't mention is that, for us to really change anything we need less people in the future. The world population has more than tripled since 1950 from 2.5 billion to more than 8 billion today. All needing food, energy and wanting a better life. However, it's not going to work and now we are seeing why."

Will be interesting to see what this hot water will do in the hurricane season.  Let's hope Mar-a-Lago gets struck and leveled.
I wanted to add that warming oceans means the creation of hurricanes. Sweden has had a weird storm weather all summer which never happened before. I think we should prepare us more against the storms that are coming.

Funny I just got back from Florida and the ocean water was nice and cool.  Kinda took your breath when went under.  I guess we should believe you because you are so credible on these issues.  The world should have ended 7 years ago based on your hysteria....
It's not Global Warming its a natural cycle- we are going into a global cooling period cycle- look at 1974 BBC NEWS
I predict when the difference between equatorial and polar ocean temp. lessens big changes will happen as ocean currents change.  Prediction is not time sensitive.

"There's a big difference between the temperature at the surface of the water and the temperature deeper into the water.  To imply, as this video does, that all of the oceans are warmer right down to the bottom, is dishonest."

"Here comes famine, I’m serious. The fish are going to be killed or they’ll find somewhere else to live.

"It feels like the messaging at this point needs to be:

""We need to start shutting down all production that emits excessive carbon or we are all going to die. ""

Followed by ""Rolling blackouts are being initiated worldwide to reduce carbon emissions. A new policy banning personal use of ICE vehicles on consecutive days has been passed and will be enforced with 30 days in jail for all violators. ""

Followed by ""A 1000% worldwide tax on all petroleum products has been passed.""

Followed by ""A worldwide draft of workers for renewable power solutions and farming has been implemented with mandatory participation. Those who fail to comply will be shot on sight.""

They can’t, they are an mindless beast of carbon debtors."

"Everything Jesus said would happen in the last days is literally coming to pass right before our eyes, biblical end times prophecy is being fufilled so fast I cannot even keep up with it. All other religions have so much error and failed prophecy but the Bible is the only one that has not one failed prophecy and is happening perfectly and accurately right in front of us. Most people don't even see it. I encourage you all to look into this and you'll see to the convergence, the intensity and the frequency of biblical prophecy that has dramatically accelerated in the last 5 years. I open up the book of Daniel or the book of revelation in the Bible and I feel like I am reading all the recent news headlines. Jesus is real and is the only way."

Edit: I’m sure we as a world could save ourselves if we could get them to stop. Being a “developing country” shouldn’t be an excuse here to continue.
Edit2: We also have to ensure the energy plants delivering the energy to energy cars and other sources aren’t burning coal which is mostly what they use. So we gotta get into the fine details here."

okay but i really think the main problem is humans. we HAVE to make laws if every country that prevent pollution.  that will slow it down."

Yea we had no rain
I love the warm anyways lets have climate change.
we could need a little warm here and there... keep rising!
Where I live in the United States the whole entire spring summer and fall were average to below average. It was cooler than normal!
"No, my Girl Crush is hotter than that.🙈"
😮
In my area it was hot. Like it was cold for 2 weeks in January then everything was way above average!
Well they just started recording like 100 years ago.
"In S.E. n.s.w  Australia it was not overly hot for me. Actualy felt cooler than 20 30 40 yrs  ago imo and this summer is quite mild I feel compared to other decades imo but...I can only speak for where I live.
I see the opinions vary from absolutely it's hotter to absolutely not...... so ?"
Republicans won’t understand this 🤨
And we finally have snow today!

Every yr feels hotter at this point!!!!😩
IT'S SO HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m in an area that’s supposed to be about 45 rn it was 68 today butte county California btw
It was the hottest year ever in Arizona. This year was so hot that even the wild cactus started to die.
For the past 10 years it’s been the hottest year ever
"The most rapid and significant warming period that we have ice core data for occurred approximately 12,000 years ago.  Not many cars or factories around then.   Next was the medieval warming period, followed by what is known as the little ice age which ended in the mid 1800s.   Which by sheer coincidence (lol) is when temperature data started to be reliably recorded.   

We’ve been recording the rise of temperatures to normal levels after a few hundred year cold period.   Gee."
"Definitely not in the UK. It was hot two weeks in june and one week in august, around 30 degrees. Appart from that it has been rainy and cold all year long."
LIE!!!!!
"I live in Eastern Canada,,, and we had the coolest wettest Summer in the 59 Years that I have been living on the Eastern Canadian Coast.."
Blame the Auto industry for this. Carbon build up throughout the years made our climate the way it is
It was miserable here in Texas. So I am enjoying this artic blast
"Well, cool 😎"
P R O P A G A N D A
South Carolina definitely did have the hottest summer and since it’s been winter it’s been colder than usual
I wish it was here in Denmark it hasn’t been nothing but blizzard blizzard and rain

And it’s only gonna continue to get hotter
"Well, I guess that explains why we were able to still be swimming in late September, which never happens for us where I live"
Well maybe if climate arsonists weren't setting forest fires and filling the atmosphere with smoke it wouldn't have gotten quite so hot.
Personally 2020 was hotter in my area
Africa was supposed to have a winter last year. It was even hotter than their regular summers. That how hot the earth got!
Yes
"Don’t worry y’all, we’re balancing it out with the cold winter this year! We’ve had snow twice this year already"
😂😂 the earth will hit the sun there's no point to spend all that money for nothing
scaremongering
Stop HAARP and stratospheric aerosol injection
This makes sence
It wasnt the hottest in the uk that is for sure!! Nothing like the summer of 1976.
We have to change our ways as a human being
ask yourself... in the heatchard over the yeara.. there was 1 that was cold... it was the only year in the past  30 years that there was not 1 single war in the whole world. SO DO YOU KNOW THAT ALL THE BOMBS AND STUFF IN THE WORLD CREATE 10 TIMES AS MUCH POLLUTION IN THE WORLD THEN ALL THE FABRICS AIRPLANES AND FARMERS TOGETHER?!?!?

"The blame should never not fall onto the average individual to change their lifestyle in order to put a dent in climate change.

"The disclaimer in this video is wrong. It reads “long-term shifts” in the climate. That’s wrong. The problem is that these aren’t long term shifts, they’re incredibly short-term shifts, which means our environment can’t adapt. The core problem of climate change is how QUICKLY the environment is changing. Get it right or don’t do it."
Yes we are now witnessing a climate disaster that will only get worse. About four years ago we noticed it in our weather pattern. I have no doubt. Even is we stoped all green house / carbon gases today we would still see the climate getting worse for the next few tears. But we won't do that. Instead we as the human race will figure ways to live with the worsening climate and continue to poison our world. And we call ourselves the most intelligent life form on the planet!
"https://bbea.org/languageFiles/78933EnglishTribulationMap.pdf not climate change just God trying to get this world's attention to coming events like the Rapture, 7 year tribulation and 2nd coming of Christ.

plant trees?.. STOP cutting TREES down. the LUNGS of Mother Earth.  ☯☯☮☮♾♾
So the global warming tax that Americans pay are going to be shared equally by all the global countries? Got it
BTW all those union pigs that called us crazy . Took our guns our rights our dignity.  All oil soaked pensions.  Corruption is genocide!!!!!
"20,000 years from now mother earth would save itself..and civilization would be hard to find.."
"This is false information, produced from selective data. While planting trees and preventing contamination of air and water is imperative due to deforestation and poor practices the notion that our climate is changing due to man made CO2 levels is ludicrous.  We need to get back to responsible behavior based on reality instead of these preposterous assertions of false science. Boiling oceans, bleaching of sea corals, mass extinctions,  seas rising by tens of meters, unbreathable CO2 levels across the globe. True naturalists and conservationists will do the right thing without these ridiculous lies. And that is exactly what they are."
"The planet is 7.5 billion years old, who was here to put out the fires lightening caused a billion years ago in California, The flintstones? If lefty would stop starting fires to advance their ""man-made"" climate change, there would be no problem. People have already been arrested for purposely starting fires including a college professor this last summer.  The leftist media is not in any hurry to report this issue, you have to dig deep to expose these articles. ""400,000-year Global chart"" will show the planet heating up runs in cycles every hundred thousand years. The road to socialism is ""climate change."" Take the detour."
Maybe consider stop purchasing and consuming animal products
All the news channels do is sit and complain so they have news to talk about.. there's billions and trains of plastic items that all need to be recycled soon as they break them factories keep going and going and going until the planet is destroyed and all the water they use they have so many pipes in the bay and it spits out in the bay! They're putting this world so fast even if we send all of our factories to China they have to walk around with mass on because of all the factories in certain areas in China because of all the factories. The wind will blow and we still are breathing in the toxin fumes. And fast fwd 20 more years! Ozone sun rays will cause even more skin cancer and water gets worse and u name it. Stop quarter a billion factorys now! From our kids hurting and there kids in future will have to suffer! Stop stop factorys asap! Whos in charge!??
"Wild fire are going to put many more tons of carbon in the air, and then there will be less forests to filter out the carbon from the air. We are already in a feedback loop."
"The human primate is undoubtedly the most brilliant of any animal species but at the same time, it is also the most profoundly stupid. No other animal consciously destroys the very environment it is dependent upon for survival, except for the human. In our ignorant quest to destroy the planet, we are also causing the elimination of millions of other animal and plant species. Earth is currently in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. The previous extinctions, mostly attributed to climate change, killed an estimated 75% to 96% of all living things."
"Climate change is a LIE.
The types of climates are: Tropical, Desert/dry, Temperate, Polar, Mediterranean.
There has YET to be any instance of one climate in ANY area on earth changing from one climate to another or any evidence thereof. (1)

"The Forestry majors in the West are trained to delieniate trees, which weakens the trees and causes forest fires.
What Joe Biden can do is transition these Forestry majors into the new Green Energy sector, because we don't want them to weaken the trees any further, which was something that was secretly implanted into our society possibly by the Cabal?
Tree delieniation was most likely introduced into Forestry majors by the Cabal.
And that's why these weak trees are now catching on fire more than ever.
The secret plan to weaken our trees was done by the deep state to destroy our planet.
Summary--->
These wicked people from outer planets knew that weakened trees will cause forest fires. So they snuck this into the Forestry curriculum."
A disastrous climate is possibly the worst of problems.

"Can anyone articulate the international transition plan to convert from fossil fuel to electric power? 

Studies from MIT and private organizations have identified the current infrastructure cannot support the future electric energy demand, and projected wind and solar technologies are incapable of bridging the energy gap. 

Hardest question is: How do we get Russia and China onboard?  Without their full cooperation our efforts will only delay the inevitable. Are we, as a world population, willing to expend the resources necessary to effect regime change in these countries?  

Also understand there are nearly 200 coal-fired power stations under construction in Asia, including 95 in China, 28 in India and 23 in Indonesia, according to data from U.S. nonprofit Global Energy Monitor (GEM).

Grid protection against cyber-attack, physical attack, and electromagnetic pulse are other concerns.  Do we have a plan to protect our energy generation and transmission capabilities from these threats?

Nuclear power is probably a thing of the past and hydro-electric generation is significantly constrained by environmental issues and drought conditions; what other sources of electricity generation can we expect? 

Do we have a plan for the safe and environmentally sound disposal of spent batteries from these vehicles and other devices once they’ve reached the end of their useful life?"

Big polluting smoke stack factorys push out trillions of smoke day and Night!. Wake up its the worst thing man done is make billions of plastic bottles n plastic plates! World wide. We used to drink from washable cups n plates..  Then the plastic has to be recycled as soon as it gets a little piece of cake or some chip crumbs on it gets thrown away or recycled bunions and trillions and trillions of 300 count per person per Town per state per country and that's just one Factory there's a factory for every single topic nowadays all these new inventions pollute we have to stop all these factories and just have a few or climate change will happen so fast we won't know what hit us
Some people only see and understand a crisis when they start to burn. I am worried about a thermal runnaway effect. The hotter this planet gets the more fires. The more fires the more co2 the more co2 the hotter it gets. Then even more fires...But which ever way global warming  is going. It should be treated as a worldwide state of emmergency NOW. Not when you start burning later.
I don’t guess all those massive military weapons blowing up into the climate is harming it one bit. They sure do seem to do a lot of damage. But we sure can’t give up those things though.
"A few years back it was acid rain, didn't materalize. Then it was the ozone layer that was deteriorating, didn't materalize. Not buying into global warming either, in a few years we won't hear about it either. The earth goes through natural warming and cooling cycles throughout history. God will control the weather and the climate, he's perfectly capable and he dosn't need our help."
1° is A crisis
Biden shut down the keystone pipeline which made the united states energy dependant on other countries and he wanted war with Russia. Europe shut down there energy and use only solar and wind. Now the energy crisis is starting to become very obvious. Energy dependant Europe must now rely on coal. Which will increase greenhouse  gasses by 40 percent that's just Europe causing a 40 percent increase in greenhouse gasses world wide Where is Greta doomsburg. This is really going the wrong direction under Biden.
"The one question I have after all these years and I’m not doubting what may be happening but why all of a sudden now just like a light switch storms are more this is more that’s more and right away every segment runs to the statement of because of man burning fossil fuels there are so many other things that contribute but yet they run right to the fossil fuels as if there was an agenda, Why don’t they include the HAARP machine that is a government program that is the capability to change the weather if it’s changing why don’t we change it back, If this is so real why aren’t all avenues looked up unless it’s done on purpose for an agenda because when the ice caps melt don’t they re-freeze in the winter these are all Viable questions nobody wants to answer, But that’s just my opinion"
"1960’s experts said we would run out of oil in ten years.
1970’s experts claimed in ten years another ice age would be upon us and we trained in school for imminent nuclear war…
1980’s experts predicted acid rain would wipe out all the vegetation and we would starve within 10 years
1990’s experts said the ozone layer would be depleted and we would all die from radiation poisoning within….. 10 years
2000’s Y2K and within 10 years the polar ice caps would be gone.
2010 within 10 years the East and West coast of the USA would be under water.  

The only thing accomplished by all this fear mongering were huge bureaucracies created and funded. Tax hikes and a federal debt that most likely can’t be repaid. 

Don’t get me wrong, we do not understand how to live on this planet…. The American Indians, aboriginal, and many other indigenous could show us the way… I just don’t see anyone giving up their cars, air conditioning etc..

Bottom line it’s not Science all politics, driven by the almighty dollar…."

So how do we know when the climate crisis is over? I bet it will be when we have no money left.
"The changing climate and new vectors of pathogens are caused by the economy. Emissions produced by economic activity are persistent, irreversible, and their effects are non-linear, they compound. Unfortunately, atmospheric C02 is correlated with global GDP, so as long as markets grow the future will be increasingly horrific. The economy is the problem. It is necessary to adopt a new model that is not based on growth or industrial production, and uses low energy inputs. To be politically acceptable, It has be equal, and have a minimum quality of life guaranteed. Human civilization has only existed in a stable climate, but the climate will now be in constant change. We cannot rely on the past as a guide, and only know that the future will be worse. Perhaps gradually, or abruptly it will become horrible, and then unliveable. Perhaps in weeks or decades, possible in centuries. We can only know that this will be the warmest summer for the rest of our lives, and make the future less terrible by sacrificing today."

"For the past two decades, much of the hysteria about global warming — later re-labeled “climate change” — has been based on the so-called “hockey stick” graph produced by Michael Mann. The graph, shown below, has been used by the IPCC, the media and governments to push global warming hysteria to the point of mass mental illness, where Democrat presidential candidates claim humanity only has 12 years remaining before a climate apocalypse will somehow destroy the planet.

But the hockey stick graph is a fraud. A man-made computer software algorithm generated it, and the algorithm is rigged to produce a hockey stick shape no matter what data were entered. Like everything else found in the rigged world of “climate science,” the hockey stick graph was a fraud the day it was generated.

Michael Mann didn’t like being called a fraud by his critics, so he sued them for defamation. And late last week, one of those lawsuits was concluded by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada, which threw out Mann’s lawsuit against Dr. Tim Ball. But there’s more. According to"

First of all we must achieve real rights, force the state to obey, and only then try to do something about the problems of humanity.

"Beef is not that impactful on the environment. Lands used by cattle cannot be used in agriculture in the first place. Water drunk by cattle is urinated and sweated away like every other living creature which contributes to the water cycle. Over 84% of cattle food is non-human edible and in the case of non-monogastric animals like cows, that percentage rises to 90%. Methane coming from all livestock contributes to just 2.7% of the total greenhouse emissions of the US."

"My belief is that there is no turning back. I believe that we should just be happy and content with our lives, until the situation arises with the world on fire. Then idk I’ll be sad. But for now I’m gonna be happy and eat meat, bc corporations are too corrupted fo change their ways."
"*CAPTURE THIS*
Humanity will ruin this planet period"
This is the most sensible and coherent video made and should be a driving force for everyone.
"Or we can just allow to live with certain standard only countries that actively reduces their population. I mean if we were 500M instead of 8B we could just do whatever we want. So if you want low price air ticket and meat, just don't make children, we europeans are good on that way, without immigration in about a generation we should be sustainable for the amount of land we own. We are way less than chinese and we consume way less than the americans."
Its easy...  Stop having kids!
"I don't have much to say, but, regardless, I want to thank the team behind this inspiring channel in my own small way: by leaving a like and a comment. My vote for more, I suppose.
Let's go make a difference everyone.

Also, this bird is a powerful vibe: (14:16)"
"We need nuclear. It's the most carbon neutral power option possible. From there we can start looking to position that energy into something practical for replacing other emission sources, if not outright capturing carbon from the air using currently available technologies."
"Recycle trash, recycle cans. Build stuff so we don't have to breed dirty air"
Its not the individuals responsibility to fix it. No one should change there lifestyle but the responsibility belongs to those who can come up with a solution.
"Please do a video on CLEAN MEAT.  LAB GROWN meat could change the ecological face of the planet, the financial systems, and the societies of the world.  It would stop animal suffering, reduce the use of water, and give habitat a chance to replenish."
"Election takes place in Germany this Sunday. And I still have hope for my country and that my fellow Germans will vote for the planet and not for the industry. I already voted by ballot for ""The Green""-Party (yes it is their name in German), who have the best program  of all major parties, proven by many independent institutes. Then something happened: Yesterday a talk show was streamed with some high politicians and one of them from the Social-Democratic-Party said a sentence, still shooking me now. Quote:""You don't win elections by telling the truth [about climate change]"". And that's straight up true, regarding the percentage distribution of the latest polls. ""The Greens"" are only on third place because people fear the loss of their wealth, but don't listen when the IPCC sais, that we are fucked, if we don't change drasticly or that future generations will lose their home or that the costs for changing are much lower than the costs we will have to face, changing nothing. For me it's like, if they don't see it, it doesn't exist for them. And I rly rly hope, that we get the change we need in Germany."
Okay
"Its hilarious to think that there are people who assume that human beings can cause climate change or any form of climate destruction to the earth. We've been here a short while and we REALLY think we are the cause of this ""Global warming"" theory. The earth has gone through more chaotic severe events before we came along. Maybe we should ask those people at Pompeii that were turned to stone by volcanic eruptions if they felt like they cause climate disruptions. Or the Aztecs that are buried beneath Mexico city due to earthquakes, floods etc. People want to worry about Climate change yet we still haven't figured out how to get along with each other lol Humans are so self-centered XD"
lol that thumbnail and title change
"Well, eating less meat is debatable as its alternatives arn't better and buying an electric car depends on how the energy is produced in your country, and it's maybe no a good idea if you already have a working car, because it makes a lot a co2 to construct"
Our problem is TRADE.
In germany we say: „der Markt regelt“.
it's all about mentality
"No solution will ever stop volcanoes from erupting, which is where most of green house gases come from. Mt. Pinatobu in 1991 released more CO2 into the atmosphere than humanity has in it’s entire existence, and the annual bush fire season that sweeps across the Western US and Australia sets back out efforts by 3 years, and again that happens every year."
"Politics are about the slowest gear in the machine thats called society, but simultanously its also one of the most powerful ones.
Though forcing the big corps to reduce emissions to near zero fast is like trying to move Thor's hammer. And you will never be worthy.
It's because of the force of habit and technology fatigue. Changing the way things are being made requires ALOT of dosh, dosh those companies aren't willing to invest cus ""why change a running system?"" Plus most of our products are being produced in poorer countries."
Imagine downvoting this video
sad one ... our voting went into the void... - Greetings from germany here
sooo... do riots and civilwars on people who refuse to be cancelled for thier poor reasons?
I feel like I emit so much Co2 without even realizing
What happened to the title of the video? Hacked by Turkish hackers? Or done accidentally by Turkish staff members?
let oxygen not included players take over easy fix
"Why don’t we just take those glaciers and throw them out into space then? I think we’re done here. If Elon threw a car into space, then we can do icebergs."
Thank you for spreading awareness among us citizens. We will do our best as individuals for the welfare of this planet and and the survival of our species.
Yes we could fix climate change but it would probably be in moral as f*** so we don't do it
Great video! Wish i could mandate everyone to watch it.
We are bacteria inside a cultivating chamber.
I love this  video but it makes me feel so overwhelmed 😞😞
This videos needs to be regulated everywhere
"I see the climate change as throwing trash in the street.
If YOU don't do it, you're helping, of course. But it's TOO little. 
If WE don't do it, WE're helping, of course. AND IT'LL HELP A LOT.
We need personal responsibility but at the same time, we need to focus on the industry, politics and other stuff.
My parents teach me to, not throwing trash in the street, using less plastic bags, and a large etc.

English isn't my native language."
Congrats on trending!
"So, basically, we're fucked"
One must not compare natural emissions with artificial ones and one must not go to 0 CO2 emissions as this would mean DEATH !!!
"I’ve been telling my peers this for years that sure, your own incentives in saving co2 can only be positive if everyone starts doing it. The politicians are the ones who can make a change by systemically steering the industries. However… in countries such as my own, voting out certain politicians who are doing poorly in our intrests and voting in others does not make any changes - just the same actions are being dine by different people."
This is what i wish for...
You'll get your climate when you fix this damn door!
"Very informative video! Nice job on this one, it is definitely needed."
I won't bother doing my part if companies/govt's don't.
"Agreeing with everything said in this video. however I’m extremely doubtful we’ll ever get anywhere that your conclusion poses. 
admitting that we need to take steps backwards is almost like admitting that humanity has peaked, people will refuse this no matter how bad the consequences because progression has been at the forefront of human development since the species branched out. We will kill this planet and there’s nothing we can do about it, it’s just a matter of how long we can hold on to a dying planet. 
even then, that’s not totally true earth will be absolutely fine it’s just all the creatures on it that will suffer. earth will come off much stronger when we’re all dead"
Rich people should not give up luxury lifestyle
"tl;dr: We're fucked. We aren't even at *this* stage of the debate. Huge swaths of the global population still reject that this is even happening. Corrupt politicians have turned this into a political issue, when it should be something that we are all very concerned about. By the time enough of us acknowledge that climate change is happening, altering its course will be a bygone possibility."
"The problem is, we people are just lazy bastards. We value our comfort and wealth more than the entire biosphere with fate our descendants, and we are not really willing to lower our standards of living, which, for almost everyone in relatively rich countries (richer than Pakistan, Afghanistan etc.) is ridiculously bloated anyway. Unfortunately, we don't think about future generations, who don't have a voice (yet)."
Sup
China can. Because they are the biggest cause.
"I think people should do psychedelics, art, and stop giving a f*ck. Do you actually think this is a solvable problem? A global pandemic which completely shut down all of our lives for over a year amounted to a 7% reduction in CO2. That honestly seems like the best we can do. 

The extinction of the human race is an inevitable outcome in this universe. We are a flawed species, greedy and power-hungry. Those in power will do everything they can to stay in power… down to the last oil drop… we cannot fix this issue no matter how hard we try. All we can do is delay devastation. Just swallow that pill and enjoy life while you can."
Your solution is voting is politicians? Wahahaha nah we are fucked.
"I want my country to cut VAT and implement a £500/tonne CO2e tax

It's an effective way to try and get emissions cut (though it'll have to be tapered up)
It'll apply to all imports and even shipping CO2
and according to the 2019 figures for CO2e and VAT it'll be revenue neutral
but it'll highly incentivise more environmentally friendly behaviour *everywhere*.

back of the envelope taxes would be
£1.50 / litre fuel
£300  / passenger / long haul flight
£16 / passenger /  short haul flight
the problem is taxing food
£31.00 / 100g / beef (yes a £35 tax per quarter pounder)
£5.40 / 100g / cheese
£4.80 / 100g / pork
£3.60 / 100g / chicken
£2.60 / 100g / fish
and
£375 / shipping container from china"
"Please believe you guys make such a huge difference in the world. Because I *will* share this video <3

Edit: I just saw an advert on a YouTube video furthering the misleading notion you can make a difference >:( it’s so true..."
Eat your bugs. Stay at home. Don't use plastic. Seems everyone is going to LOVE the future
yes!
"Can YOU fix the Climate? 
to

İklim Değişikliği Sorununu SEN Çözüme Kavuşturabilir Misin?"
that why my gole is to do this
This is a great use of your platform. I got so sick of the personal responsibility bull coming out of everyone's mouth and this is a great rebuke Edit: maybe using Gates as a sponsor when it comes to messaging like this is irresponsible
"I hate to be pessimistic, but I think climate change will have to run its course. There's simply too many people who won't change and we're so close to the point of no return."
"Well put. It is nice to have information not fear mongering. Yes I would like to see an ecosystem that allows for life as we know it to continue into the future. Do I think we will get there, unfortunately no...  Perhaps this is the ""Great Wall"" of  life in the universe. Once intelligence happens a lifeforms travels down the path of polluting it's fishbowl until it becomes extinct. We do not see ""Unintelligent"" life making its ecosystem unsustainable. I do not mean to seem negative just trying to make an observation. Please do not just ""like or Dislike"" this I really want to hear responses... thank you."
"I get the point you are trying to make. but during Covid, we didn't consume less. We consumed more."
This video was supported by Bill Gates. Not even a meme.
the answer to a lot of things seems to be nitric oxide
Great! Where are those science caring politicians you speak of?
Love adding to my climate anxiety
So you're saying we should abolish capitalism? Agreed.
"What about Selective waste collection? That react a same tiny lot if lot of people do it? (like food, and electric car, and light safe)"
"""vote with your wallet""  I just wish there were more stuff you had the option for that. Planned obsolescence and removal of repair options are a dual nightmare that is perpetuated by supposedly ""green"" and ""responsible"" companies like a certain fruity empire."
Could you please talk about the difference between Fossil Carbon and Green Carbon?
Liberals should watch this they are too simplistic in thinking.
"the solution is obviously, fewer people."
"The only way to stop climate change is a GLOBAL emissions trading, with every major industry taking part.With an absolute emissions cap, this will make climate friendly technologies cheaper than emitting co2. But the problem is getting everybody on board. This is the single biggest Prisoner's Dilemma we have on earth. I sometimes doubt if we can manage this, but it seems the only way..."
"lmao for the first time I heard someone speak about this shit from a non-biased perspective....honestly I dont think anyone is gonna fix this not today or maybe not even in the future. people vote for politicians to get the current politicans who they think are ""bad"" out of office...instead of voting for the guy they think will be good for the country...an example is the recent US election....everyone voted to get the supposedly ""bad"" guy out and no one even paid attention to the other choices..."
Well i think its pretty clear now
"I don’t think the comparison between a person’s carbon emissions vs. global energy industry’s emissions should discourage anyone’s efforts to reducing their own carbon emission.

According to those numbers from the comparison in this video, if 3 billion people reduced their emissions to 75% of the average person’s emissions for their entire lives (~70 years), that would be equivalent to ~71 years worth of global energy industry’s emissions.

Obviously, this may not be realistic but it goes to show how much emissions we would prevent if we got a couple billion of the 7+ billion people in the world to slow down.

That’s also not considering that the global energy sector will also emit less if 3 billion people were living slower and emitting less."
Greta approves this video
tRusT tHE sCiEncE bR0. Don't forget that in the 70s they thought we'd be in the next ice age
With Biden here this siduation will get fixed
"Title: ""Can YOU Fix Climate Change?""
Thumbnail *NO*

what"
Sad that you get fouded by Bill Gates and even DARE to call for the corrupt system...
"At one point it's stated that there are several political inclinations that offer drastic and effective solutions, yet at the end you marry to one of them: vote in people willing to use the force of the government, spending and regulation to solve climate change... No thanks..."
Also population though... Everyone dances around that the global population needs to stop growing & maybe even shrink a little; it would undeniably help.
"Interesting, video. I ain't disagreeing with the content and info.

Its wild watching this knowing that
Jeff Bezos real time net worth is 196.3 billion. 

The greedy bastard and his rich friends can literally invest a huge chunk of their money every week towards that 10 trillion that is desperately needed and they would still be rich.

Idk, man. Maybe I'm being unrealistically cynical because most governments pretty much dropped the ball and messed things up. Mind you, the economy is pretty messed up for very obvious reasons too. 

Well, let's just cross our fingers and hope for the best."
Who’s here before the title changed
Oil and gas stocks are good to have. ConocoPhillips and Lukoil are strong.
"All these it is crap.
I em old ...Al American president tell the same thing and nothing happened.
Now government introduce al these in taxes.
Al these is human stupidity taxes"
The video commentary was just about word for word with the UN narrative on CC. Guess good idea otherwise any other opinion would of had video pulled. We still cannot debate freely.....
Ok thcr sadia
Thank you i hope the we work together as climate change
"@jaxswinsflawlessvictory Tell them when a science cant explain the heat wave of 1930s and 1540s that killed 1 mil ppl , but believes today situation despite all recorded data show improvements , is worsenning and a doomsday awaits us (recorded data show droughts are declining, storms are declining, climate deaths declined tremendously, earth is 15% greener and etc)
Its obviously not science , its propaganda !"
"How can carbon dioxide be a greenhouse gas when it is 1.5 times heavier than air?
When it is emitted it only rises to a small extent and then eventually falls to the ground and dissolves in the Earth's oceans.
This is why its atmospheric concentration is only 0.042%.
In my opinion is that those who own everything and make the decisions are greedy scum-bags.
They are the ones that create wars and crises in order to milk the people out of their taxes, and this includes the current hysteria of ""climate change"". They are the ones that jet around the planet and tell us that we a facing a climate crisis, and that WE need to resort to eating bugs instead of meat. Meanwhile they live in castles and have much more than they need.
If any global warming happens it is completely due to the sun.
I find that the rapid human population growth and the wastage of resources is a greater problem for the planet.
Soon the planet will reach 9 billion and everyone will want to live like an American.
The solution?
Nuclear power is the way to go."
"I am a science teacher in Korea, and I started YouTube. I am collecting a lot of science-related materials"
Personally i couldn't care about climate change . After the just stop oil lot have pissed every one off i don't care anymore.
"Climate has been changing for ever, always will.  Next, they will tell you there is no border emergency but there is a climate emergency."
UNITED NATIONS. Climate change refers to long term changes in the way peasants live to benefit the rich. 😢
Moral of the story we are screwed
Climate change is hoax
"How can we solve the prolem when key decision makers live in air conditioned room. These decision makers must be in open air for them to feel the  effects of global warming,not just hearing about it while they swing in lazy man's chairs in air conditioned apartments. My Khoisan African ancestors were wide to live in harmony with the forest by eating, cultivating sustainably. Too much carbon footprint by western selfish individuals who live in air conditioning rooms are blind to the fact."
Plz .another one viedo🎉
Bs
"The Northern hemisphere is 33% greener than it was in 1900. Sea levels are rising at the same rate as they were in 1865. The hottest decade on record sine the ending of the ""Little Ice Age"", was the 1930s into the early 1940s. The earth cooled from from 1940 to 1979 by .3° C. 

There was no warming between 1998 and 2015, the Earth has not warmed since 2016. From February 2016 to February 2018, global average temperatures dropped by 0.56° C. The Earth was warmer, there was less sea ice, and the sea levels higher during the ""Medieval Warm Period"". 

2022 Summer Arctic sea extent was greater and the ice thicker, than it was in 2008. Antarctica has been gaining 112 billion tons of ice a year since 1992. Yet according to NASA 2022 was the sixth hottest year on record. There is no mass extinction event occurring due to climate change, the Polar Bear population is five times what it was in 1960, 
and at its highest ever recorded. 

In 2019 more children died from problems associated with obesity, than from malnutrition or starvation. In 2020 the United States produced 25% more food than it needed or could export. All major crop yields have increased three fold since the 1940s, due in no small part to increased CO2 in the atmosphere. CO2 is a greenhouse gas, however it has never been proven that concentrations of CO2 will cause warming, in fact we know from ice cores that CO2 concentration lags behind periods of rapid warming. 

The world population has exploded, however it was expected to top out at nine billion, and then begin decreasing. The reason being that as developing nations become more prosperous, they tend to have less children. By depriving developing nations access to cheap fuel, they are forced to burn wood and dung to cook, light and heat their homes, causing massive health problems, deforestation, and leading to a mass extinction event as they kill local wild life to sustain themselves with protein. Bottom line..... there is no ""Climate Crisis""

Walk outside, breathe deep, and smile."
"Another scary video about climate change to give kids nightmares.  
  Look at the climate for the last 15,000 years and you have dramatic changes. Thousands of feet of ice covered New York City. Sea level was 400 feet lower. There were huge temperature changes between 8 and 13 thousand years ago. Between 1901 and 2018, the globally averaged sea level rose by 15–25 cm, or 1–2 mm per year on average."
I hope the world will work together to solve global warming.
"GM is huge gaslight against us. We didn't create this, industry did. Talk to the stockholders and CEO’S."

"Veganism is ‘single biggest way’ to reduce our environmental impact,University of Oxford study finds

It's genuinely amazing how many truly brilliant peoples' minds fry when the ""V""word gets mentioned and they turn into the most logically inconsistent and rationally dishonest folk, and they end up providing ""really problematic takes""! Please don't be those people!

In regards to what people can do as individuals when it comes to climate change. Of course it is no silver bullet and won't solve the problem by itself, but would go a long way to helping.

Lead author Joseph Poore said: “A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use.""

The article was in the Independent: Veganism is ‘single biggest way’ to reduce our environmental impact, study finds.

And the original study was in Science :Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers.

Again, you are all probably well aware of this website as a good source of reliable information.

The website ""Our world in data"" is used as a teaching resource at Harvard, Oxford, MIT and other esteemed universities has a huge amount of information on the impacts of food choices on the environment, well worth checking out.

There is also an article in Nat geo ""How beef eaters in cities are draining rivers in the American West"" which is particularly pertinent to this.

Making the change to Veganism also allows an individual to live the most morally and ethically consistent life possible in our current system. By this I mean simply that the majority of the population considers themselves animal lovers and the vegan ethos aligns with the least amount of animal rights violations and cruelty possible at the moment.

There is now no and in fact hasn't been for some time any contention over the viability of the vegan diet, for all stages of life. If  you search online for ""American academy of nutrition and dietetics "" vegan and that will clarify the scientific consensus. They are, as I understand it, the biggest nutrition and dietetics organisation in the world, and their position is backed up by the corresponding organisation in the UK and elsewhere.

For most people with animal companions in your lives, you are very aware of them as individuals, with likes and dislikes and distinctive personalities. Is it any stretch at all to understand that the 70 to 80 Billion land animals and 3 Trillion fish that are slaughtered each year all possess, maybe some to a lesser degree, the same level of consciousness, individuality and the will and desire to live?Pigs, for example, are widely recognised as being at least as smart as three to five year old human children, and, on the scale as we understand it more intellectually and emotionally adept than dogs.

Please just ask yourself this question. What IS the morally relevant difference between those beings we breed for food and those we breed for companionship?

And for that matter the difference between ""them""(the others) and us, same answer, none.

I  highly recommend you check out Ed Winters ted talk: Every argument against Veganism and if you haven't seen it, the film ""Dominion 2018"", which is on YT, is a must watch for anyone who consumes animal products and supports other industries that exploit animals."
"@ndrthrdr12  the real c-theorist is you that think the oil companies made a time travel machine and transfered our co2 to 1540s , that caused a heat wave that killed 1mil ppl, bcuz u and ur rented (so called) ""experts"" cant explain those heat waves ,if there was no car and industries then what caused it? they completely ignore it, bcuz peasants brain like u think like :""if something goes viral there must be a good reason behind it""
Bombard the peasants with those scary predictions and SUPPRESS any DEBATE that is forming, then the stpd peasants have no reason to doubt the trend !
their science today is based on this stpd fact"
We saw the Earth’s dress rehearsal to Climate Change as we experienced the Covid Pandemic. We fail failed miserably! Can’t wait to go live with Climate Change!
There is no climate emergency. The Earth was warmer in the recent and distant past. It also warmed faster in the past. Yawn.
the only problem for everything is the CAPITALISM
Nice video.
May the Anthroprocene epoch make the Permian-Triassic extinction event seem like a minor footnote in the pages of Earths history. Here's to making scenario SSP5-8.5 of the IPCC assessment a reality.
"On two occasions, the Earth was frozen and thawed by warming up, before Humans inhabited the Earth. Theorized by numerous Scientists given the evidence at hand, known as ""Snowball Earth"".  Climate change is a real thing, and has been happening for a millennia. If we are able to mitigate Human activity as it effects the planet, the Earth is still going to go through it's natural climate progression. That is fact. Do Humans play a role in speeding up increased temperatures? Yes. Starting during the industrial revolution. Looking at both ends of the spectrum here, between the Earth is frozen, and the temp is too high, neither one can sustain life as we know it. Question: Can you stop the Earth from warming? No. I do not understand how hard that is to comprehend. Global Warming is happening and will happen no matter what we do. Can we slow it down a little? Maybe. The only thing you can hope for at this point is a Super Volcano erupting, making the Earth ice again. How do you combat global warming when the Earth was warming before Humans were ever involved? Come on."
I hope this video will become an opportunity for more people to become interested in solving climate change.
Tony Heller says bs

"Why do all the people who believe in ""climate change"" buy million-dollar homes on the ocean if ""climate change"" is a real and true danger? Answer that."
"Wow, just like me, there must be others who are unaware of most of this information. My interest was piqued by a Physical Science class on a NASA report on climate change in today's 20th-century world. However, just like me, a significant percentage of humanity may be oblivious to these facts because we don't stop to listen carefully to how all this is impacting our CO2 greenhouse world in terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP). This is very enlightening. I will commit to sharing this knowledge and being a part of saving our world, making a difference starting with my activities as a human being and following the guidelines on how to contribute. We definitely need to come together as a community, city, country, and worldwide to bring this to greater attention, especially how it contributes to the destruction of our greenhouse effect and the increase in GWP. Thank you for sharing this information."
i think this is still too complicated for jordan peterson to understand.. can you make it more simple??
"Why are these video getting such low view count, I don't get it"
"Thanks, really good knowledge as always. Please keep them coming!!!!"
CO2 emissions do not cause climate change. It’s chemically impossible.
👍
"There is no such thing as man made climate change, climate change is one hundred percent natural and zero percent man made"
The planet can only sustain a certain level of population and very few world leaders are addressing this.
it really nice
Wrong
"We have made the fatal error of being too dependent on other countries. China has been the world’s largest producer of pharmaceutical ingredients since the start of the millennium, and it now produces 60% of all intermediates, which are the essential building-blocks for the active ingredients used in medicines. Although both the European Fine Chemicals Group and Aschimfarma, through its Vice-President Baccalini, have shown that Europe can cover 90% of the production and technology requirements for the 350 pharmaceuticals tested, it is home to just one laboratory covering all the stages in the production of life-saving antibiotics such as penicillin. The EU is 85-90 % dependent on the Chinese market for all ingredients and 33% dependent on it for active ingredients. WAKE UP PEOPLE. I extra made a song that talks about this and other issues."
"I really enjoy when you use terms like unprecedented rate without telling us the rate.  How much is the ice sheet retreating?  Oh, I forgot,  putting a number to it would open you up to rebuttal."
"I certainly admire anyone's passion, to clean up the planet, but it seems, that as some people's passions grow....their brains shrink. As a Power Engineer for 42 years, here is what I know. Roughly 75% of our Electrical demand (Our Lights/Heat/Air Cond./Phones/Internet/etc), that we take for granted, is supplied from Fossil Fuels. Roughly 25% comes from a combination Nuclear Plants, Hydro Plants, Windmills & Solar Panels. Biden & Trudeau (for us Canadians), shutting down the Oil & Gas Industry, does NOT solve anything. If Fossil Fuels, still make up 75% of the supply, to fill the demand, if we're not drilling/processing the Oil & Gas..........the 75% of demand, has to come from somewhere, otherwise we'd all be sitting in the dark, with no Lights/Heat/Air Cond./Phones/Internet/etc....The fact is this: Biden & Trudeau are shutting down the Oil & Gas Industries here in the USofA & Canada, and spinning it, that they're doing it to clean up the Planet, but are actually still burning the Oil & Gas, to supply the 75% that we need........but they're buying the Oil & Gas from Saudi Arabia/Middle East & Venezuela. Having typed all of that, the cure is NOT to stop burning Fossil Fuels...........it's to stop burning the BAD/TOXIC Fossil Fuels (i.e.: Coal, #6 Fuel/Bunker C, and Diesel Fuels).  If the whole Planet could stop burning the BAD Fossil Fuels, I'm convinced that the Planet could heal itself. Quit being lazy. Look at photos online of smoke stacks burning Coal, and then look at stacks burning Natural Gas.....you'll be amazed at the difference."
"Harvest Time is nearing. We will reap what we sow. If only we realised  how humanity destroyed the nature given by our Creator, we  will regret of abusing the gift that was freely given. But instead of regretting and stop abusing, we continue to destroy and never repented  and become more abusive. We then now called it Climate Change. Is it really a Climate Change or human character change? We've been created beautiful by the Powerful All Knowing Great  Father in heaven. But what we did in exchange? We destroyed His creation. When are we going to  come to Him and ask His forgiveness and follow his Laws and have Covenant with Him?  You can reply me, and I will lead you to those who are gifted with knowledge and wisdom of the Heavenly Kingdom. This Heavenly Kingdom is now starting to grow, and soon will become a huge one. Just like the mustard seed, when it grows and become a huge tree it can shield many.  Be blessed."
Climate change is a scam made up by Al Gore and his partners
Can you dumb this down a little more?  I was hoping to find something my mother would be able to easily understand.
Global warming is due to sun activities or green house gases? Need to get more data to know which is the true cause
Allt är helt normal inget konstigt politiker ljuger bara värdelösa politiker
Global Warming is when i cook my breakfast eggs outside on the car`s hood
"Climate change has nothing to do with auto exhaust or emissions. There has been a substantial increase in seismic and volcanic activity over the last hundred years. This has increased the temperature of the land, sea, and air. The weather is most likely changing back to what it was 2,000 years ago. When the Romans were in Britain (40BC-380AD) they grew citrus fruit in the north. Look up ""Roman Warm Period"" and ""Medieval Warm Period"" online. It appears that there is a major change every 1,000 years and that is where we are today. Periodic change in the heat, light, and radiation created by the sun affects the earth both above and below and is the cause of the global warming we are experiencing."

"Fun fact, global warming started to trend up in the early 70s, at the same time the EPA began its existence."
there is proof that we are coming out of an ice age.   what happens when we come out of an ice age?  the earth gradually warms up!!

"The truth is, we do not know precisely how much co2 is affecting the atmosphere. There are a lot of feedbacks both positive and negative. The problem is they change so often that it is impossible to say which is affecting the climate more. Take for example, clouds. Low level clouds are more transparent to infrared, meaning more escapes to space. At the same time, they are more reflective to sunlight. This means they cause the earth to cool. High level clouds are more reflective of infrared, meaning it causes the earth to stay warm. They also absorb more sunlight meaning it warms the atmosphere during the day. Water vapor also traps heat, unlike co2, which releases it as fast as it gets it in the form of infrared. So when a low energy co2 atom hits a water vapor that has high energy, it steals some of that energy and releases it immediately. Water vapor can catch the frequencies that co2 emits on, meaning it traps the heat.

What this means is if the majority of clouds are low level we have negative feedback to co2 increases. IF the clouds are high, we have positive feedback to co2 increases. The problem is that we have to model the atmosphere at about 1/1000 of what our best computers can do, to figure out the truth.

Since no computer can handle that, we use models that use a range of a variable called ""climate sensitivity to co2 changes"". They do the runs with the variable at one level, then again at a second level and so on. They often start at .5°c per doubling of co2 and go to 5°c per doubling of co2. The models at the low end are accurate, but can not predict a disaster. The ones at the high end do predict a disaster, but after a decade are considerably off. After 2 decades that are way off, and after 3 decades, they are outrageously off. YET they claim the top end is off and we will have a tipping point which switches the sensitivity from the low end to the high, but so far none of these tipping points have done anything."
"CO2 absorption of  terrestrial IR occurs at 15um wavelenth and follows ""Beers Law"" - college chemistry basics. The absorption is maximized, 99.9%, in under 10m from the earth's surface at CO2 concentration of just 200ppm or less.  Increasing CO2 does not increase absorption further, so there is no increase in IR energy absorption from the earth's surface with CO2 doubling. This is basic college chemistry and physics of the issue. The truth is that CO2 increase does not further add to the greenhouse effect  than it already does. There is a great series of short 4min lectures on YouTube about the details by Michel van Biezen."

"More absurd conjecture based on a FALSE PREMISE; the still UNPROVEN AGW HYPOTHESIS. 

If climate narcissists want people to take them seriously they need to first do the following:

1) DISPROVE the established science on CO2 which shows the warming effect of each molecule of CO2 declines as its concentration increases, 

2) PROVE the AGW hypothesis with data and observable evidence in a repeatable way, and 

3) PROVE with evidence that CO2 causes all of the random problems they report.  

Until then it is perfectly reasonable to conclude that the never ending counter-intuitive alarm about CO2 is irrational and motivated by other factors. 

In reality, the actual experience of 1°C warming over the past century hasn't been bad at all: life expectancy increased, biomass and crop yields increased, cryosphere remainds, sea levels rose normally, coral reefs grew, economies prospered, poverty declined and loss of life from weather catastrophes dropped. Moreover, half of warming occurred before the use of fossil fuels. 

A small change in temperature did not mean the difference between normalcy and catastrophe. A degree of warming so mild that nobody would have noticed were it not for the 24/7 unsubstantiated fear-mongering propaganda."

"Self extinction is what will save this planet. Regardless of climate change, extreme weather patterns and gloval warming /cooling the earth will continue to exist, just without us humans. Are we actually concerned about the earth or is it simply the fear if our own created demise? 

Other thing to take into consideration of global warming is also Earth's orbit around the sun at times at a perfect distance other times closer or farther away. Take into consideration that our Sun has also become hotter than it was when it first started out.  Yes, us humans messed things up for ourselves but the earth will still be here."

     Yes, God will not allow the earth to be rendered uninhabitable. Rather, he will intervene in human affairs and bring an end to failed human rule and those who have no regard for the earth. At the same time, he will preserve alive all who lead morally upright lives and sincerely want to please him. Says Proverbs 2""21, 22: ""The upright are the ones that will reside in the earth, and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it. As regards the wicked, they will be cut off from the very earth; and as for the treacherous, they will be torn away from it."""

"“The 98% claim (from 2009) was based on a single survey by a University of Illinois professor and a graduate student. They sent a 2-minute online survey to 10,257 earth scientists. They got 3,146 responses to only these two questions…”
The first question asked, “When compared with pre-1800 levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?” The second asked, “Do you think that human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?”
Ninety percent of the respondents said that the mean temp had risen, while 82 percent said that human activity was a significant factor. However, the term “significant” was never defined. Furthermore, according to the Heartland Institute, most skeptic scientists would agree with the statistic if the term was defined.
The video explains that when formulating the 97 percent statistic, researchers used only the responses from “climate scientists.” However, only 5 percent of the respondents – 79 people – were climate scientists.

So, out of 10,257 academics that the professor and graduate student identified as worthy survey participants, only 79 were in agreement with their final finding. When calculated, those 79 scientists – now accepted as 97 percent - make up a meager 0.77 percent of academics. And, since only 97 percent of the 79 answered positively (which would be 76.63 people – so we will round to 77), the percentage shrinks from 0.77 percent to 0.75 percent.

"Part 2
The Arctic ice doesn't melt. In fact, the ice volume in the Arctic has not changed since 2007. (10).

The ScienceFiles articles on this show that the Arctic ice doesn't want to melt and that it is also vinegar with the Northwest Passage

Polar bears are not on the verge of extinction. There are more polar bears than there have been for a long time (11), which we have already reported on ScienceFiles.

Even Greenland is not becoming the new sauna of the northern hemisphere. The island is largely stable and its temperature pattern is similar to the pattern that prevailed in the 1930s and 1940s (11).


The Antarctic is not melting either. In fact, between 1979 and 2012, the ice in the Antarctic has been steadily increasing. (12).

Sea levels are rising by one to three millimetres a year, as they have done over the last 1000 years. There is no evidence that sea-level rise would accelerate as a result of man-made climate change (13).

Extreme weather events are not increasing.

Historical data on forest fires show that although there are more forest fires, forest fires are getting smaller and the area destroyed by fire has been decreasing for decades. (14).

Periods of drought have not become more frequent. For example, a study of the drought that affected Cape Town in 2015 showed that precipitation has not changed significantly since 1900. What has changed is the population of Cape Town. It has increased tenfold, with corresponding effects on land consumption, land sealing and lowering of the groundwater level. (16)

The number of hurricanes in the North Atlantic has not increased. (17)


The number of tornadoes has decreased in the USA. In 2018, for the first time since 1950, not a single severe tornado has been recorded in the USA.

Coral bleeching, which is interpreted as a sign that the Great Barrier Reef is dying, has been shown in a study to be a normal phenomenon. Since 1700 there have been two corresponding events, in the 1750s and the 1890s. In both cases, the Great Barrier Reef has recovered. At both times there was no relevant CO2 of human origin. The conclusion is that coral bleeching is a normal process in the life of a reef. (19)

The influence of the sun on the earth's temperatures is undisputed, but is far too underestimated in the IPCC models. Henrik Svensmark and Nir Shaviv have shown that increasing solar activity, accompanied by a rising number of sunspots, strengthens the Sun's magnetic field so that less cosmic radiation reaches the Earth. This reduces the ionization of air molecules. Less cloud nuclei are formed. The clouds become more transparent, less particle radiation from the Sun is reflected, and the Earth's surface becomes warmer. In times when the sun is less active, has fewer sunspots and a weaker magnetic field, the process is reversed. With the theory of Svensmark and Shaviv the historical sequence of small ice ages and the warm period in the Middle Ages can be predicted very well (23). Not humans, the sun determines the earth's climate and the influence of the sun on the earth's temperatures is much higher than assumed by the IPCC (24).


Besides the solar forcing that has just been described, there is also an ""astronomical forcing"", i.e. the position of the Earth in space and in relation to the Sun and other planets also has an influence on the climate: ""These oscillations are not reproduced in the IPCC models and imply that astronomical forcing of the climate system have been underestimated or even ignored, and therefore that anthropogenic warming has arguably been significantly overestimated"" (24).

What is described here is nothing other than the Milankovic cycles that we have described here.

Moreover, all the signs indicate that we are on the way to a small ice age, i.e. that global temperatures will fall by 0.4 to 0.6 degrees Celsius in the next few years, in the next decade (26). We have compiled much of what there is to know about the coming ice age here.

Much of what we have just compiled has been processed by Tony Heller in the following video, which we consider one of his best videos.


Anyone who, after this tsunami of facts, still claims that man-made climate change is a fact can no longer be helped - due to the extent of his stupidity - or must be assumed to be making this claim out of material interests."
"Another parrot blaming fossil fuels, no one talks about the changes in the solar system, and how those are influencing the planet to heat up.     Fuels are just a joke."

"Even though water vapor is the largest contributor to the greenhouse effect, because it is condensable, it does not control the Earth’s temperature. Instead, temperature gradients are dependent upon the levels of non-condensable greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, et al. This being said, it is known that carbon dioxide and such will remain active in the biosphere for hundreds and hundreds of years. This, however, will be a moot point if runaway global warming occurs because then humanity and much of life on Earth won’t be around to witness it.

"This reeks of neoliberalism. The problem isnt just global warming, it isnt just deforestation, nor is it ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, and microplastics. These are just symptoms of the same problem. It’s really the economic system we maintain that pushes all of these problems into existence. It’s the way humans in wealthy countries generate, process, distribute, and consume endlessly that leaves billionaires running companies with enough power to circumvent attempts by the people to stop them. Fighting all of these issues at once is very important and very practical as we have plenty of people to focus on very specific aspects of each environmental problem. However, people need to keep in mind what the real issue that drives each of these problems is and who really is to blame. Corporate lobbyists and corrupt politicians from both parties have reduced the power of democratic institutions and therefore the working class.

Yall need to look around you. Carbon isn't a green house gass either. Stupid people deserve to be scared.
 What they don't mention, because their is no money to be made. Is that Earth is cooler than it used to be. We are actually entering a mini ice age."

And now get fucked."

thats why ill destroy humanity first :)
Eh... Who cares
You think it's bad now? Wait for 2040.
"Soooo by destroying the world, u earn money.....👏👏👏"
actually sad
The beginning of the end.
"I would like someone to explain to me how a warmer Earth, with much more water in the atmosphere is going to produce more worldwide drought.  From my understanding of climate variations, in the past, when the world was warmer, the Sahara Desert was a wetland forest environment. That is an area larger than the United States that will be Africa's breadbasket.  Also much of the land in the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia as well as North America will be transformed from permafrost wasteland to rich, productive farmland.  Loss of a few miles of coastal plains, which is mostly just used for resort playgrounds for the wealthy, is hardly a reason for panic.   We are headed toward a major cooling period, leading to the next glacial ice age. Maybe that should be more of a long term concern than temperature rise.. It is estimated that an ice age will likely reduce the human population by half, no matter what steps we take to maintain it.   Think about it... Don't react to what the U.N. is telling you. Their main goal is total control of humanity.... not saving it."
They've been saying the same shit for years... Guess what? Nothing has happened. It's the sun.
"Even if we tried to do something, it would be too late, which is why I never worry about it. What happens happens, everything is temporary and if that’s the way we go, that’s the way we go. We’re all tiny, indescribably small cogs in a machine that is so big, it doesn’t know we’re there. If you’re not religious then I could see people being scared. If you’re religious then you know that this is not the end, which is why I guess that’s why I’m not as worried. Try to live your best life."
They wont be Scott free on judgement day.

"Okay, generally (and I include myself on this), people would not be willing to change their current lifestyle in order to tackle climate change. We are always so quick to attack the rush and wealthy, but who's feeding them? Stop using your car, stop buying cellphones, stop supporting them. If you simply sit there and complain and don't change your lifestyle, nothing will change. Focus on yourself first, then move onto changing the world. You cannot expect these corporations to change, they will not. WE have to change, as individuals."
Quazi-science.
"When I finally become a novelist, I will write a dystopian novel about Earth in the year 2100 suffering from climate change, pollution, species extinctions, and ecological collapse. Sea level rise displace many people from now-submerged coastal cities, and floating cities are built to house those refugees and replaces the submerged costal cities. The people living in poor countries will suffer the worst consequences due to disease, droughts, and natural disasters. A species is declared extinct literally every 8 hours due to high extinction rates. Due to overpopulation resources are extremely limited and strained, and the now dictatorial (called climate governments in my future novel) governments will enforce laws that will limit or outright ban population growth. Due to lack or resources societies even in rich countries will break down. Humanity will have no choice but to accept the fact that they will become extinct in just a few years. Global warming had finally reached its tipping point, and it is too late to slow it down."
And here I knew we were screwed 10 years ago
why the fuck am i going to school for
Fuck me I don’t want to live anymore.
hahahaha
Just a fun little reminder that this video was made 2 years ago... yeah... we ain't gonna have a good time.
"I love you, Earth. I'll try my best to keep you alive"
"Answer this question:

Why shouldn't I kill myself? Why is it so hard for me to commit suicide? It would benefit the planet in the long run. It would benefit humanity in the long run. It would be one less mouth to feed. It would be an end to the pain.

Please, if anyone has any suggestions on quick, certain methods of death, let me know. I don't want to keep contributing to the problem. I want to be part of the solution."
If only I had an axe in my hand and the CEO of Exxon in front of me.......
That the rich could avoid the consequences of climate change might be a misunderstanding. Unforseen feedback loops might make the whole world uninhabitable for any human being.
We are f*cked
"Well. Feel nice to study the shit out of me for just being doomed by the generations before me. 
We have to take the shit that the other generations have made and they depend on us to clean up their shit and then complain that climate change is fake news. Men with suits that only thinks about money are the reason why this is happening and we who study for a future, that we will not have, are taking the consequences. We tax the shit out of gas here in Sweden while china and India are dumping waste in our oceans, pouring Co2 in the atmosphere. Shit, can't even take my goddamn Volvo to school without someone here in Sweden is complaining about me being destructive to the planet. Meanwhile you Americans drive around with diesel trucks and the gas prices are cheap as hell compared with Swedish gas prices. Take some fucking responsibility and grow some balls fucking twats."
"I could say this until I’m blue in the face but the climate alarmist will not believe me or call me a climate denier whatever the hell that means LOL how can you deny something that very clearly exists, that’s like saying you deny that air exists lol..  The reason why governments all over the world especially governments of coastal countries and islands but the reason why they’re not doing a damn thing about radically reducing CO2 emissions is because none of them really believe it, if governments of the world honestly Believed even half of the catastrophes that people are calling for then the rich and powerful, World leaders, people like Al gore and Michael Moore etc! They would not be buying up property and building houses on the coast. Instead they are actually profiting from it! Campaigning on it, flying all of the world and using it to push their agenda, Pushing climate change has become a billion dollar Industry and is good politically for governments all over the world with various carbon taxes and subsidies for The solar industry, it’s used to influence and change Society on a global scale! if they actually believed these things would happen they would be doing something about it in their own life at least! Nope I am afraid to tell you that people who believe this climate catastrophe mass extinction, Global starvation and drought, The planet will be underwater in the next decade or two, billions of people will die blah blah blah! These very same people have been saying this for more than 50 years now and absolutely none of their predictions we’re even close! As a matter of fact  rising CO2 levels and rising global temperatures has had the opposite effect! Countries all around the world are producing more food than they ever have! More than a billion people throughout the world have risen out of poverty in the last few decades! We have been producing far more food then we even need,  Many of these first and second world countries have an obesity problem! The scientific community when it comes to global climate measures things not on the scale of years or decades but in hundreds of years and thousands of years so just because temperatures have risen 1-2 degrees in the past century means absolutely nothing, yes global temperatures are rising but they have also been rising since the end of the last Ice Age, Water levels may have risen in some parts of the world but they have also gone dow water levels may have risen in some parts of the world but in other parts of the world water levels have gone down.. when I hear people freaking out over CO2 levels and believing that we have caused irreversible damage to our planets climate so our children and grandchildren will  do not have a future, it drives me crazy because that is just flat out wrong! Human activity only contributes about 3% of the total annual CO2 levels added into our atmosphere every year! Fucking 3%! So when they talk about CO2 being the driving force of climate change, well no shit Sherlock CO2 is carbon dioxide and everything in the world, everything we’ve ever known in the sky above to the dirt below, you me, plants animals everything is made of carbon, literally everything because we are a carbon-based species and planet.. pumping more CO2 into the atmosphere if anything would be a good thing because CO2 is basically plant food, plants absorb CO2 during the day and release oxygen as a byproduct, this is called photosynthesis..  basically what I’m trying to say is to not believe this ridiculous extinction level nonsense because I promise you earths climate is not going to turn on us, we have periods where earth climate is very stable and we have hot periods and we have cold periods while some areas and countries receive lots of rain while other areas receive little I mean we don’t have a static climate.  There’s a handful of things that can drastically alter earths climate such as solar activity and volcanic activity and A substantial magnetic shift of earths poles, an astroid impact etc... CO2 levels rising is not going to do a damn thing because our atmosphere is only 0.04% co2, 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 0.93% argon and various other lighter gases. If anything a rise in CO2 would coincide with a rise in oxygen so that would actually be a good thing..  i’m not saying we should pollute our planet, we should absolutely take good care of it and clean it up but hearing videos like this just tells me that this person is naïve as hell"
Son of a b***ch!
"Hi my name is jesse and i am 18. The sad thing i realized at the end of this video is that i was not surprised nor terrified. I was raised in a world where climate change was a problem since the day i was born. Its to the point now where when i hear the news that hundreds of millions will die i don't even flinch nor give it a second though, just a well i guess living to age 30 isnt half bad. Its just tragic, but what ever."
watching this before the election LMAO
"Well humans need energy to survive. Unfortunate but true. Limiting energy will kill an many people as climate change itself.

"the money those ""criminals"" have amassed was given to them freely by a middle class hungry for new toys, gadgets and adventures.
personal responsibility is the ONLY solution.
when each individual cuts down on their own wasteful over- consumption, demand will go down and the supply chain will slow down production.
the desire for unnecessary STUFF is driving industry, which is driving climate change.
don't give up!!
fight back by cutting back! 🌻
only if we all (or, at least, 75% of us) do it will it work.

"All of this is shit communists around the world have been warning and fighting against for generations, because the struggle against colonial imperialism and the struggle against capitalism are tied together with the struggle to protect and save our global biosphere. Capitalism's goal is to convert every possible natural resource into a commodity (manufactured with the exploitation of underpaid workers globally) that is sold for an obscene profit to workers in the global north (eg. the west, north america, etc.) This never ending quest to acquire more resources to convert into commodities to be sold for a profit occurs at the expense of the overwhelming majority of the world's citizens, our environment and biosphere. Think of all the forests in the Amazon and elsewhere that are destroyed to expand privately owned farms. Thinking of the polluted and destroyed communities in Latin America and Africa that are exploited to obtain the rare earth minerals that go in the electronics we use every day. Each of these products is manufactured at a cost to all of humanity. But until the chains of imperial-capitalist military domination  are broken via the overthrow of the imperial core (the United States) we as a planet are utterly doomed to a cataclysmic and apocalyptic future. It's Socialism or Death."
"Communism is a preferable alternative to death

Just good. If nature dies humans go with it sooner or later.
"Well put sir! It's even grimmer when you have more data like these, how screwed we are if we keep following this stupid capitalistic money grabbing country's. How can any in his right mind be ignoring or down voting this? And if you do, you are writing down your own death sentence!"
Didn't they say stuff like this back in 1980?
I hear China puts out most of it

More people should see this
"My mom watched a movie on Netflix which really shows what our future would probably become.

It showed how the entire world became polluted, and if you breath the air, you’d die within seconds. 

Only the lucky rich people survived by buying a flight to Mars. The person we are following was living inside of a lab where she she was safe in her area thanks to probably the trees and how nice it was"
We Gen Z have to fucken do somethin when we grow up and some Millennial also because if we dont stop this there wont be any 2069 so we should go do somethin

Its to late now just do what you want it doesn't matter

F*** that.  Our only option is now is industrial scale carbon sequestration."

"We could be in one of the last 10 generations of humanity and everyone just goes about their lives like nothing is wrong,why is the human condition so."
It is a hoax. This is a cyclical change that was predicted over 50 years ago by the US National Weather Service.  There is a political agenda behind it. Look at the data yourself. The real data not the fake charts and cherry picked garbage the UN is feeding you. The sea level has been rising at a steady rate of under 3 millimeters per year for thousands of years. It has not increased its rate in the last hundred years. Polar bears are thriving. We are having bad winters. They have been predicting 10 years to doomsday for the last 30 years. The ship that went to prove the lack of Arctic Ice got stuck in the ice and so did the ice breaker that went to rescue them. If you want to take the easy route look up Tony Heller on YouTube and he will lay it out for you.
So is a hope lost? :(
The scare tactics on unproven CO2 (correlation does not equal causation) did not work. Not the UN is pulling 180-degree from the previous position screw Africa and the other poor areas to we should now all feel guilty.
"What if I end the world before climate change gets us? I think that’s a much more dramatic ending than “yeah, nature kinda f*cked us”

Idk"
Climate engineering!
The UN scientist that came out with the data that started the whole global warming alarm admitted years ago it was a hoax.
we are in the endgame now
humanity should all just die and not exist i am not like a human
Maybe its time to use alternative energy and mass production of it without gas and oil
This ain't a joke y'all. There are human lives at stake. We messed up and we gotta pay for our mistakes.
"I was always fascinated by fire and now I get to watch the world burn.

"Grand Solar Minimum, not co2 hoax nonsense"
Don’t you no that governments can control the climate .? You need to wake up
The car has gone off the cliff already. It's TOO LATE NOW. You cannot reverse what is irreversible. Tipping points have passed. READ the research...
LOL nothing will happen... countries didnt change because they are afraid of being left behind... and people will not change because if they protest masks.... can you imagine what people will do if government limits meat consumption? because the meat industry causes a HUGE amount of CO2 to the environment
"No, the Earth is not hotter than it has ever been since humans began to walk the planet. The Medieval warming period was several degrees warmer with man surviving quite embarassingly to the members of the First Church of the Climate Change Faithful. In fact, the Earth has quite often been warmer with the hottest years of the twentieth century coming in the first half of the century. 

Interesting how these videos miss those inconvenient truths."
"NO SOLUTION FOR SAVING THE PLANET, BECAUSE ONLY N47 YEARS ARE REMAINING  PLANET WILL BE BURN FOR MILLION OF YEARS"
No one cares.
"Impressive series of plain language explainers about climate change. 
However, the title of this video is misleading. The remaining carbon budget is smaller than you suggest. Such budgets are uncertain, but the expert consensus is that we have around 7 years of BAU global emissions (assuming pre-pandemic levels) for a 2/3 chance of limiting global heating to no more than +1.5 Celsius. Halving global emissions over nine years, as the film suggests,  is inadequate unless humanity simultaneously develops negative emissions technologies to sequester carbon on an unprecedented scale.
Essentially, we cannot delay emissions cuts. Every day counts if our children and subsequent generations are to inherit a habitable planet.

Hi
"So what everyone is just gonna give up, all I hear is complaining and not enough doing. To change the world you gotta first change yourselves."
"""Climate change ""
Ba Humbug!😂
WE DONT HAVE A CLIMATE NOW!
Where do you draw the line? Of climate. Especially if the system is GOING TO CHAOS?
🤬🌎💀"
"The worlds climate has always changed and will continue to do so with or without humans.
We are currently in a warming phase which has and is continuing since the last ice age.
Without carbon based energy we will fall back to pre-industrial levels of comfort health and security. 
The temperature warming data used in modelling 'so called' human induced climate change is fraudulent and around 50% of the data is estimated. Past warmer periods have been cooled within the modelling process so as to emphasize the largely natural warming trend.
I am all for not polluting but that needs to implemented within a coherent strategy where all nations work together. China and India are by far the largest polluters at this time yet you green warriors say little to nothing about that.
The science behind the panic mongering ""were all doomed"" nonsense is based on lies, data manipulation and vested interests."
Fuck human anyway
We've lost nearly 2 years of our lives to Covid. I couldn't care less about climate change. I'll travel where I want to go.
"Jack, I would love to use solar on my house or turn my 2 & half acres for a solar field, but the solar that's going to have to go onto my house, 2bd., 2bath & a small shop, which I think you would agree this is a very small residents compared to other homes, it's going to cost me $90,000.00 to put the solar I would need to run this home.
I can not afford this w/my fixed monthly disability income of $1,100.00. During the begaining of the year. I have to decide if I pay rent, buy food, pay my electric bill, or any other bills or do I get my 3 insulin for my diabetes & the pain meds, 2 of them, that help me get out of bed & walk cost me $950.00 month.
I will not try to attempt doing a solar system on my own. I know electrics, but not comfortable doing on my own. I don't want to burn down my house that my grandfather built w/his 2 hands. He worked to hard for me to destroy in one day. No way will this happen.
Yes, the government here in the USA does give you a rebate, but I don't make enough to fill taxes under their rules. I did the math & I don't even make minimal wage. It comes out to $6.80 hour. Man I'm raking it in being disabled & I do not qualify for ANY EXTRA HELP!  I've tried ever number they have giving me to see if I can get extra help. I always get, ""You make $10.00 to much for any help"" Plus the government will not let me get a part time job to help me pay for all my medications. 
I would loose my disability so called benefits. It's all bullshit & I'm sorry for the words are not to pleasant. But there true statements that a lot of other people go through also.
Also the electric company will not pay me for the extra engery I produce. They just take it. Tuff shit they tell us. If we don't like it don't use our electric company. WTH! I paid good money for this solar & you will not buy it from ""MY ELECTRIC COPO""?
My non for profit company! Unlike your company that's all for profits.
So needless to say I did not get a solar house or field full of promises. I got no dream of all.
I do wish y'all luck w/all this climate control & all the prayers to keep everyone safe durning the protesting y'all do.
Best regards, 
""Chris""tina from Missouri"
KEEP it rolling!
"I have seen some numbers on the GHG from animals farming for our meat industry is extremely huge, so one way to reduce the GHG to fight Climate change, I suggest eating fewer meats. Some documentary films you can watch to understand more is Cowspiracy and Game Changers <3 Thanks, Jack for talking about this burning issue"
"What complete utter nonsense in 9 years , you think all this is going to happen huh, 20 years ago we were supposed to be a flaming ball of fire by now , there is always a new boogeyman , Covid , Climate change , etc , etc"
"one thing that nobody seems to say im gonna say it. i blame the science community a LOT. theyve known about all this and have been timid little sheep for decades. DECADES if it were me i would have made huge public demonstrations as soon as it was clear it wasnt being taken seriously enough by governments which was back in the 60s and 70s.  i also despise scientists because theyve all known we were in huge trouble but most of them have just contributed more and more towards capitalism towards the creation of things, plastic crap that benefits nobody long term. most of them have been careerists. most of them are elitist little nerd scurn"
"You do realize that my late mother was told this very thing in school in the 1930's & 40's (global heat waves -- in the 30's they had a heatwave across the entire USA for several months,  with temperatures over 100 degrees for 6 weeks in the northeast).   Only a decade or two to act to prevent climate breakdown.  I on the other hand was warned in school about the soon coming ice age (within 15 years) unless we acted right then to melt the ice caps.   Researching the climate change agenda history,  I found the same types of warnings in Scientific American ""unless we act NOW!!""  in the 1910's,  1890's and 1870's,  with the risk of ice age or global heat waves replacing each other every 20-30 years...  It appears that the climate change crises have more to do with funding for scientists and control by politicians than any actual non-cyclic climate tends."
"Of course this didn't show up on my feed even though I've been subscribed for years. So, I turned on notifications✌🏼"
"The Treaty of Paris is not worth the paper it was written on.
We have already exceeded the 1.5° Kelvin mark. This is because the cooling effect from air pollution, which is currently cooling the atmosphere by a few tenths of a degree, must be added. We have lost the Amazon. It is now a carbon source rather than a sink. We will lose the ice sheet in the Arctic. The Arctic will soon be ice-free in the summer. We will lose the ice sheet in Greenland. It rained there this summer at over 3,000 meters. Something that shouldn't be there. We will lose the permafrost in Canada and Siberia. And at the same time, more than 400 new coal-fired power plants are being built as we speak. That doesn't sound to me like climate change is being taken even remotely seriously. We are on our way to a Mad-Max-World. I'm glad I don't have kids. The future is going to be really tough in a few decades."
"RIght. We have less than 9 years to halve emissions. Some are commenting is though we are too late already. The truth is, it is never too late to improve our situation. So don't let this ""its too late"" meme drag us down. Its clearly too late to avoid 1.1 degrees C of warming and almost certainly to late to avoid that the temperature rise will cross 1.5 degrees C of warming (even with a very aggressive program). However, worlds that are far better than the worst outcomes are still within our reach and we need to be striving for them."
What horsesh&t.
"Antichrist & Signs Of The End

2 Esdras 5:1-13 (Deuterocanonical Old Testament)
Archangel Uriel: ""Now concerning the signs: behold, the days are coming when those who dwell on earth shall be seized with great terror, and the way of truth shall be hidden, and the land shall be barren of faith.
And unrighteousness shall be increased beyond what you yourself see, and beyond what you heard of formerly. 
And the land which you now see ruling shall be waste and untrodden, and men shall see it desolate. 
But if the Most High grants that you live, you shall see it thrown into confusion after the third period; and the sun shall suddenly shine forth at night, and the moon during the day.
Blood shall drip from wood, and the stone shall utter its voice; the peoples shall be troubled, and the stars shall fall.
And one shall reign whom those who dwell on earth do not expect, and the birds shall fly away together; and the sea of Sodom shall cast up fish; and one whom the many do not know shall make his voice heard by night, and all shall hear his voice.
There shall be chaos also in many places, and fire shall often break out, and the wild beasts shall roam beyond their haunts, and menstruous women shall bring forth monsters.
And salt waters shall be found in the sweet, and all friends shall conquer one another; then shall reason hide itself, and wisdom shall withdraw into its chamber, and it shall be sought by many but shall not be found, and unrighteousness and unrestraint shall increase on earth.
And one country shall ask its neighbor, `Has righteousness, or any one who does right, passed through you?' And it will answer, `No.'
And at that time men shall hope but not obtain; they shall labor but their ways shall not prosper.
These are the signs which I am permitted to tell you, and if you pray again, and weep as you do now, and fast for seven days, you shall hear yet greater things than these...""

Didache 16:1-8 (Apocryphal New Testament)
""Watch"" over your life: ""let your lamps"" be not quenched ""and your *loins"" be not ungirded, but be ""ready,"" for ye know not ""the hour in which our Lord cometh."" But be frequently gathered together seeking the things which are profitable for your souls, for the whole time of your faith shall not profit you except ye be found perfect at the last time; for in the last days the false prophets and the corrupters shall be multiplied, and the sheep shall be turned into wolves, and love shall change to hate; for as lawlessness increaseth they shall hate one another and persecute and betray, and then shall appear the deceiver of the world as a Son of God, and shall do signs and wonders and the earth shall be given over into his hands and he shall commit iniquities which have never been since the world began. 
Then shall the creation of mankind come to the fiery trial and ""many shall be offended"" and be lost, but ""they who endure"" in their faith ""shall be saved"" by the curse itself.
And ""then shall appear the signs"" of the truth. First the sign spread out in Heaven, then the sign of the sound of the trumpet, and thirdly the resurrection of the dead: but not of all the dead, but as it was said, ""The Lord shall come and all his saints with him."" Then shall the world ""see the Lord coming on the clouds of Heaven...""

Apocalypse of Elijah 3:1-18 (Apocryphal Old Testament)
""The son of lawlessness will appear, saying, ""I am the Christ,"" although he is not.
Don't believe him!
When the Christ comes, He will come in the manner of a covey of doves with the crown of doves surrounding Him. He will walk upon the heaven's vaults with the sign of the cross leading Him. The whole world will behold Him like the sun which shines from the eastern horizon to the western. This is how He will come, with all his angels surrounding Him.
But the son of lawlessness will begin to stand again in the holy places. He will say to the sun, ""Fall,"" and it will fall. He will say, ""Shine,"" and it will do it. He will say, ""Darken,"" and it will do it. He will say to the moon, ""Become bloody,"" and it will do it. He will go forth with them from the sky. He will walk upon the sea and the rivers as upon dry land. He will cause the lame to walk. He will cause the deaf to hear. He will cause the dumb to speak. He will cause the blind to see. The lepers he will cleanse. The ill he will heal. The demons he will cast out. He will multiply his signs and his wonders in the presence of everyone.
He will do the works which the Christ did, except for raising the dead alone. In this you will know that he is the son of lawlessness, because he is unable to give life.
For behold I will tell you his signs so that you might know him.
He is a... of a skinny-legged young lad, having a tuft of gray hair at the front of his bald head. His eyebrows will reach to his ears. There is a leprous bare spot on the front of his hands. He will transform himself in the presence of those who see him. He will become a young child. He will become old. He will transform himself in every sign. But the signs of his head will not be able to change.
Therin you will know that he is the son of lawlessness [Antichrist]...""

The Apocalypse of Peter - The Ethiopic Text (Apocryphal New Testament)
""Enoch and Elias shall be sent to teach them that this is the deceiver [Antichrist] which must come into the world and do signs and wonders to deceive. And therefore shall they that die by his hand be martyrs, and shall be reckoned among the good and righteous martyrs who have pleased God in their life. [Hermas, Vision III.i.9, speaks of 'those that have already been well-pleasing unto God and have suffered for the Name's sake'.]""

And they shall see the men who were taken up, who from their birth have not tasted death; and the heart of the earth's inhabitants shall be changed and converted to a different spirit...""

The end will be just awful. The fight for survival begins. Where's your next glass of water coming from?
"What effects are we already seeing? Floods and droughts are not getting worse. The latest IPCC report confirms this. Burn acreage in the U.S. has been in precipitous free fall for the last hundred years. Go to the American forestry web site. Hurricanes have been consistent over the last hundred years. They are not getting worse or getting more severe. Google any hurricane graph. Death tolls from every single natural disaster including every single climate disaster has fallen over 90% over the last hundred years. This data is easily found. Data proves that humans have never been safer, healthier or more prosperous than at any time in history."
"Problem is, those who watch videos like this are mainly people who are already concerned, do understand the danger we're in, and I expect a lot of us are trying to change our lifestyles step-by-step to try and reduce and even reverse the damage 'we're' doing.



The many that don't care about it, don't want to think about it, don't believe it, or simply 'don't know' about it - will just carry on as normal. Unfortunately, they form the vast majority - and we few cannot undo their damage for them.



You might ask, who could not possibly know by now?



I was watching another climate related video a short while ago, and one young man (who also feared for the planet's future) was despairing at the lack of knowledge among his country-folk. 
They burn fields prior to planting more crops, burn tyres to just get rid of them, their cars are very old, inefficient & numerous, thousands of trees are felled for road-building, and they still produce too many children as tradition dictates. 
They have no idea of the harm they do.
Another person in another part of the world said the same lifestyle is applicable to his region: aged cars dating back a few decades. Too many children. Rubbish is burned.



Of course, both their leaders (and many others in the same situation) will smile and sign anything, but will they bother to educate the people? Can they reach 'all' the people with the information they need to know?



Yes, the West has exploited some of these poorer countries in the past. But there's no time for blame games. When it comes to the planet dying it is not going to pick zones and leave the harmless just because it wasn't their fault originally. 
Nor does it care about China's claim that it's 'their turn' to be highly industrialised to the point they are a major contributing factor to climate change.
The climate doesn't care about 'fair.'
It's not going to be a good enough argument to say - well it's all our fault and so must the remedy be. 


Yes, it is our fault technologically speaking - but poorer, uneducated and downright reluctant nations outnumber the willing people within Western populations many times over. Such nations either have so much of our old tech (dating right back to the 1930's in some cases) or their own inefficient inventions, and they will see no harm in continuing to use it because they don't even know or care that there's a connection between that tech and climate change."
"At 4:58 you claim a Blue Arctic (an Arctic ice-free summer) occurs every 100 years. This is false. The last time the Arctic was ice-free in the summer, human beings didn't exist."
"Wow 😯 you people really aren’t that smart are you. 
You know that big earthquake that we just had in Alaska, well Jupiter just passed into a alignment starting to form out in our outer solar system with Saturn and from now until 2024 things are going to continue to get worse in total there will be the 4 gas giants that will cause our planet to go through a lot of changes and it’s already starting so get properly informed and prepare for survival"
"its not to save the planet! the planet will be just fine, that is an important point. time is running out on saving humans,,, and the countless number of species that are unwillingly caught up in this $$$ mess. wake up!!"
"""It'll start getting cooler, you just watch,"" Climatologist Dr. Trump said

"The answers to the author's two primary questions are unchecked human greed, and therefore nothing, respectively."

"We have less than 9 yrs. Maybe 5 at most. We are wiping out our resources. In times of desperation history has shown we are no different than a pack of hyenas. In the name of God, the law, our age any excuse to justify the murder of innocent people for being present at times of turmoil. Humanity is obsolete. Be proud the only species in history of the world to kill itself and everything around us. Marvel at your glory and have more children."
China by 2060!? Wtf
We have even less then 9 years. We need Creative Society to survive as humanity in this crisis.
"9 years to be enslaved by  devils! The earth is laughing at your lies. Earth is a self - correcting system designed to feed tens of billions of people. Of course, the Earh cannot saturate the rich and the abominable globalist eltes."
"I used to scoff at preppers....

....now I *AM* one.

Good on y’all! 👍😊🤩🕊
"Even 1.5 is too little and too late. The urgency of this crisis is not adequately addressed in the mini-documentary. Yes, the changes needed are monumental and so MUCH change is needed that we need to stay within ""do-able"" limits. But we've run out of time. This is Here and Now and we are beyond kow-towing to ""do-able"" and must gear up into Emergency Action NOW."
"THESE ARE THE WORST ACTORS I WE ANY OF US have ever SEEN!!
Y (why) R (are) we listening 2 their Garbage!
WE HAVE TO SHUT DOWN NOW...!
SLOGAN:: """"There IS NO Tomorrow"""""
I wish I had a hundred dollars for every single time a climate zealot placed a deadline on something. You want to see what 40 years of climate hysteria looks like? Look out your window. People riding bikes and eating at cafes.
"It was 1. Then 1.5, and now 2. At two degrees warming, half the population is dead. Just to put it into perspective for you all. That’s what these politicians have done to us. Next year it will be 2.5. They know what they’ve done. Now they are trying to gaslight you into not taking their power from them. And no, it’s not your fault. “We” can not do anything about it. The people who control the system must do it or step aside for those who will."
The planet and climate will live on long after delusional humans kill the remaining humans through misinformation.
Would be great if you covered a video about going vegetarian / vegan to reduce CO2 emissions! (Greatest contribution most people make is eating meat... very energy intensive + uses a lot of water resources as it is terribly inefficient. Instead of eating grains to sustain us we use it all to raise cattle losing a lot of energy / wasted food in the process)
"The title at least is nonsense.  The planet is not in jeopardy, homo sapiens are.  We need to frame the fight in terms of human survival.  How long will various aspects of humanity survive when confronted with the various forms of eco disaster."
"I remember watching your old videos when I was a teenager, the ones you made when you'd just started this channel and they're a lot different from this but I really enjoy that. I'm in my mid-twenties now and it's amazing to see how you and your channel's content has grown. Kudos to you for allowing things to  change instead of sticking with your old formula"
"Get your heart right with God , Maybe Climate Change is Gods way of telling the world he's (GOD) is ready to make changes & not Big Gov't Thugs TAXING THE LIVING HELL OUT OF common people ."
"Lol we were warned 30 years ago that we only had 10 years left to save the planet by Al Gore, according to the top climate scientist at the time halve the world would be under water😂 Climate change is actually a power grab by the elites and globalists to bring socialism (new world order) to the whole world ie less freedom for you to give them more control."
Great video! Thanks for educating us.
"Actually we have to save ourselves. The planet will be fine. It was fine and great before us and it will be after us. So I think we should stop saying ""save the planet"" (those who could do big changes won't do anything) and start saying ""save ourselves"", because who is that idiot, who don't want to save themselves?"
Meer reflection or bust
"The Biden administration is currently working on an infrastructure package and I believe it should set up a US Gov't laboratory whose mission is to solve the climate change problem, given a $10B/yr budget. This money could be used to:
•	Develop factories that mass produce equipment that makes green hydrogen gas (H2), and green liquid ammonia (NH3).
•	Develop factories that mass produce generation 4 nuclear reactors, and automate the construction of nuclear reactor buildings.
The $10B/yr initiative automates, to the extent required, to make green energy cheaper than carbon-based fuels. This gets us worldwide decarbonization, since customers will buy green to save money. And this gets us capital market participation, which means banks and bond markets will pay for green energy power stations, and factories that supply them. Economic principles state that customers favor lowest cost products, and capital markets follow customers.
There is a video that talks more about this:

"Government's can't do anything they can't even agree with themselves over small issues. Corporations only care about the bottom dollar and will destroy the air, forest, and oceans for money."

"there's this climate crisis problem and companies are spending money on making computers. Many people haven't even caught up on the latest versions, plus, isn't it already convenient enough? What about cars that run with clean energy sources?"
"@ 3:20 Paris is NOT legally binding.
@ 5:08 The arctic will NOT be ice free every 10 years at +2°C. This is made up. Positive feedback loops don't oscillate around a fixed point.
2°C is not a guardrail, especially when the goalposts are continually moved. We are at +1.2 °C with reference to 1900. With reference to 1750 (the start of the industrial revolution) we are at +1.5°C."
Only got nine minutes to save the world
Well.  I'm in northern Michigan.  We are all looking forward to less severe winters.
"If anyone feels inspired to actually change the world, look into permaculture and urban food forests. Replace the waste of space and money we call lawns with productive plants. We can secure a basic standard of living for each other, ourselves, in our own communities. We can fight climate change on an individual level. We can create a future that is not only sustainable but regenerative. We can give every person the true meaning of ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" All it takes is one small step.

Permaculture could change the world as we know it. Imagine a world where all the lawns are replaced with food forests. Bountiful fresh food within an arms reach of your door. It would bring our society to it's knees and make people question if this system really is so good. With daily meals free to everyone, the biggest whip of the masses is useless. People would see that their jobs are just a means of obtaining a daily meal, giving them more bargaining power and freedom to choose what they want to do. The workers of the world break their chains and create a society that meets everyone's basic needs. A society that allows people to work towards their own goals and society's advancement in their own way without forcing themselves into servitude of people seeking a bigger high score.

Pre 2017: I was a depressed, lonely Doomer who was stuck in a pit of nihilism and misanthropy caused by humanity's inability to save themselves from their own actions. There didn't seem to be any way a single person could make a difference in our screwed up society so I gave up on the world and locked myself into my bedroom all day playing video games and watching youtube, counting down the days I wouldn't have to live in this world anymore. No hopes. No goals. Just the bitter aftertaste of this life to remind me that I was even alive. ""Be the change you want to see"" was just something I would say to keep following my own code of ethics but I didn't believe it made any difference, no matter how much I helped others. In the end, I just did it so I could have a slight bit of hope in this world that something could be better. The only futures I could imagine for myself were ending my own life or apocalypse fantasy, and it's obvious which one was more likely.

Post 2017: I'm still a depressed Doomer but I finally have a path I can take to actually have a chance to change the world, even if it will be too little, too late. At least we can get the recovery done right and put humanity on the right track to earn the title ""enlightened being."" We can actually make a difference with permaculture even if we can't actually make our own food forests. It may be a struggle to convince anyone around me to listen but at least now I actually have a reason to fight instead of a million reasons to give up. And that's all a lot of us really need, just a good reason to stand up and fight. This is that reason everyone has been waiting for the last 100 years. We can do this, together. We got this.

 We just need to take one small step. One small step to freedom. One small step towards tomorrow."
"9 years seems too optimistic. I've read several articles that stated the CO2 budget for the 1.5° goal will have been fully spent by 2027. Realistically, if we look at how little progress we've made all these decades, it seem extremely unlikely that we will be able to curb our CO2 emissions fast enough to meet the 1.5° goal, and I'm not overly optimistic about the 2° goal either."
Climates change. i guess you have never heard of the Ice ages. This is more BS to control and panic.  We have 9 years to save the world from the WEF/WHO /Banking/Big Tech/ Pharma cabal
"Save the bees, save the fleas ! The sky is falling ! The climate is changing. We are all going to die.  Ahhhh, it's all BS. We are our own worst enemy, and seem driven to find something with a cure worse than the disease. Take a deep breath, and get rid of democrats. They are the problem. Things were getting better under Trump, weren't they ? Biden is a formula for war and financial ruin. Maybe for the midterm elections, we can regain some control of our destiny."
No your wrong ! It has been hotter than this in the past! 50 thousand years ago !
Why put faith in politicians? Why not go to the oil and coal corporations that owns them!
0 years left....the pain is all ready built in...put on your seat belt people...its going 2 get bumpy..
"The Paris accord is qouted wrongly. The original road map was: 1.5C was to be achieved in 2100 after an overshoot to 2C in 2040-2050. So the original road map was to go above 1.5C for 30-40 years but not above 2C, if everybody did as suggested. It was not never to go above 1.5C!"
"They are whistling past the graveyard in these videos! Climate whatever is not a date or point of a starting gun. It is a process that began long ago long before 1880. This date is also a error in analysis. This March even in global slowdown CO2 remand above 415 PPm for a month. All agree that at 400 globally 2 C is certain, CERTAIN!. Notice they focus on MONEY/Greed, wealth on and on more insipid promotional corporate gobbledygook! The half baked clap trap is here to sell you a bag of Crap filled ILLUSIONS! If you select the correct start date of global industrialization of 1750-60 global temp rise is 1.616 C NOW!!! and rising fast. Meeting and making money plans wont change a DAMN thing! ASk what happens when Arctic ice cap melts, Ask anyone who claims expertise, I dare ya? all you will get is ""IT aint good""! Its way more than that and the experts know it will change everything in weeks and days!"
"""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man""  The Industrial Revolution started in the year 1750, (as a baseline) from that year we are past 2C. Co2 levels are past 410 ppm. (the newsroom s03e03 climate change interview)"

Don't say save the planet. Instead say save humans and living thing's. Earth tolerated many impacts.
"Elvis has left the building !! I thinx I will too .. Scuse me ,,,,,, ;-}"
"04:53. Once we have an ice free Arctic,  it will be over shortly. Where do you come up with ""every 100 years?"" That doesn't make any sense."
The governments have sentenced us all to death I hate the governments hate hate hate hate so upset the beautiful world god made is destroyed
"Yeah not gonna happen because we are past the point of no return. Look at the climate this year, magnify it by a factor of two each summer moving forward: Ice free Arctic, half food production, mass migrations by 2030; wars to envelop the globe by 2040; human extinction (and very possibly most if not all life on the planet) by 2050. It's over, live your lives with purpose but simply, and for god's sake don't have children."
BOE  blue ocean event  2022 is the end .  The cake is BAKED.
"WHY WE HAVE LESS THAN 9 YEARS TO SAVE THE PLANET! 
Correction; the planet is doing just fine, no need to save mother earth!
the title should have been: WHY WE HAVE LESS THAN 0 YEARS TO SAVE MODERN HUMAN SOCIETY! If you still believe that the planet is going to die by now... Well then things don't look good for men-kind, I would say!
And why not just call the beast by his name: Capitalism. Think about it; nothing will be done or change except when they can make a profit. It is all about profit for the few 1% . There next big solution is ""the electrification of transport"" . Well, who profits from electricity consumption ? Yep, it is an ugly beast."
Too late. Disaster is upon us
Now I'm feared and awared
Climate change and urging the entire nation and its civilians to take  action is extremely imperative. Our lives and animals are all on the verge of being extinct. The heat is negatively manifesting itself and may strongly result in irreparable casualties all around the world. This video greatly supports the evidence & negative impact of Climate Change.
"Smearing poo. Yes . yes. Gooooood F 

Big F


Major F"
Yes!! Great video!!
95% of the arctic is gone its already to late only naive dipshits think that our near term extinction is preventable
"Myopic environmentalists all believe that the earth is this pristine place that humans, like a parasite are wrecking. The earth in fact has always been a hostile place that will kill you. Humans have made it safer and more livable century after century. Global life expectancy in the 1800's was 35. People died from all kinds of disease, suffered from malnutrition and starved to death."
"WHEN IT COMES TO THE RICH LOSING ONE DOLLAR IN PROFITS...FORGET IT. THESE VILE PEOPLE WILL BE SENDING BRIBES TO POLITICIANS BY THE TRUCK LOAD. INDUSTRIALISTS CARE FOR ONE THING ONLY, PROFIT AND KNOWING THEY WON'T BE AROUND WHEN THIS REALLY HITS HOME...WHO CARES AS LONG AS ""THEIR"" LIVES ARE FULL TODAY!!!!"
"According to the very definition of carbon footprint, the notion can be applied to ""population, activity, or system of interest"".  So if we stay rigidly within the logic of carbon footprint we can, contrary to what's stated in the video, ask a question that does NOT impose ""serious limits on what we can do to limit the effects of climate change"".   And what is that question?  ""What is the carbon footprint of the fossil fuel industry?""  The industry is a system of interest.  And since the definition accounts for all of the relevant ""sinks and storage"" of fossil fuels as part of that system's footprint, it therefore includes all of the burning and all of the CO2 emissions as well.  Have I interpreted the definition correctly?"
Makes sense.
"This is incredibly short-sighted.
All the important and disruptive regulations necessary to deal with the worst polluters need a culture of acceptance of both the overall problem and personal responsibility within the general public.
Telling voters that someone else will have to deal with it, while they still want all their demands met, will not work out.
The concept of the ""carbon footprint"" might have come from scummy marketing campaigns from some of the worst offenders.
But the core message people got from it are still very valuable."
"I like the video and what it stands for and I do believe pretty much all of it, just off-put near the end when the quote mentioned who ""eat steak twice a week"" is comparable to flying excessively and buying fuel-inefficient cars. How the hell is eating steak twice a week as horrible as all that nonsense? I hear it all the time, it's frustrating."
"Take responsibility for your choices.
You do not need to eat animals or drive cars, or fly around, or have tons of kids..

You are all just childish babies who don't want to change."
global warming isnt real
The libs aren't gonna like this one :(
"Already tried one of this calculators...
It ends up I have an annual emission of 2.9 tons of CO2. 😑
Shit, I have to cut more."
Yo but like how about we let global warming kill us humans
"I believe that the carbon footprint was to tell which country emits more and whether or not they should lower their emissions by a significant margin. But the fossil fuel companies are deliberately using this as a weapon to say false facts. Plus, if that method does not work and more people believe in climate change, they will pass the burden to you and say that the middle class is responsible and not the companies and governments."
What bothers me is that some environmentalist peddle this shit answer.
"There are thousands of scientists who say there is no man made global warming-it is a scientific  fraud. There is  local man made warming such as outdoor Bar-B -Ques and campfires, tiki torches around patios etc. that warm the immediate area but none that globally warm anything. Natural global or regional warming is not in any way caused by humans. It comes and goes in  sometimes predictable cycles. The same thing with natural global or regional cooling. Ask any meteorologist."
The most carbon footprint are from manufactories but blame it to the people on eating beef.
"so basically hurrrr-communism/socialism will fix it this time, totally not gonna kill millions before it eventually fails this time, again"
"LOL... reduce your personal carbon footprint lol.  You know what reduced everyone's personal carbon footprint?... The covid lockdowns.  No driving, no going out, no buying at the stores, no littering, nothing.  And our economic system almost had a heart attack.  The world nearly collapsed in on itself.  It's almost like the customer drives demand, and businesses are the ones deciding how to meet that demand.  It's almost like, the business is responsible for who products are produce and they continue to choose the cheapest way -_-"
On the point!
"i expected that the vid would get into ""carbon credits"""
7:06 what is this lady smelling through the plastic though lol
Green movement is a scam. It is just a new way for the rich and people in power to leech more money from the rest of us.
this video was sponsored by the democratic party
"If you live rural, forget about public transportation and if you want to reduce your carbon footprint then forget going anywhere. You won't be able to find much choice for employment or groceries."
Based
"When I was young the Carbon Footprint seemed inconvenient and counterproductive it's really just a BS myth about ""personal responsibility."" And it is neither feasible nor applicable to every person when we rely on cars to commute. Great video!"
"i personally have stolen 6 tractors engine from a car graveyard wich is also used to throw tractors that are simply beyond repair. I make sure to let each of them run 20 L of fuel/day to increase my carbon footprint as much as possible, i got a deal from a friend for the fuel too but i never tolld him what i do with it. On weekends a friend of mine and i throw 2 car batteries into the local river , each at distant locations between them, this week we will go to the beach and throw around 5 each ( my truck is realtively small and cant carry as much) and we also burn alot of plastic to get rid of it wich increases the footprint even more."
Switching to an electric car from a petrol / diesal will not reduce ones carbon footprint - don't believe the hype. I'm surprised that the makers of this video fell for that.
"When will people realise that they have no control over the products available to them for consumption. EVERYTHING we can consume is controlled through legislation by government. This means that government had the power to change this but chose not to. The people NEVER had this power however, it is We The People who are blamed when in reality, the government are responsible. Those who control what we are able to consume (the cause) are NEVER held responsible. BTW mankind has almost zero impact on climate and reducing atmospheric carbon will have a catastrophic impact on plant life that need CO2 to survive. If plants die, the level of oxygen in the atmosphere will reduce significantly causing the population to also reduce significantly. Photosynthesis. Reducing CO2 is worse for mankind than Climate Change and the link between CO2-Climate Change has yet to be proved using the scientific method. Go figure…"
Decisions of what energy source and how we transform transportation will forever be chosen by politicians for likely the wrong reasons.  We will be told lies and misconceptions to convince consumers that they are doing something great.  Effective engineering that looks at all aspects of major decisions regarding energy sources will not be followed unless it just so happens to be beneficial to a politicians election (or re-election).  Bad decisions like negative energy ethanol production and the EV push to replace already existing IC transportation are just two examples.
Since the 1990's the amount of plastics used everywhere is mind boggling. Soda and Beer used to come in glass bottles that were recycleable. In the 1990's we had cars that were getting 50+ mpg. We used to have paper bags for groceries which was replaced with plastic bags. I've noticed since the Government got involved everything has gotten worse much much worse. We knew oil was a limited resource back in the 1970's so what did our world do- increased the use of it. Were not a smart species at all.
"Free market is wasteful at start but look now. Is China and Russia not putting out massive amounts of carbon. Free market is only way as we the people decide what is what with our money. Less money less buying power less buying power less power to change.having government decide how much to pollute, Just like China and Russia, that ain’t it chief."
“Neurodivergent comrades” oof. Lol.

"Thanks for the info, much needed"
"“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be ""cured"" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.”"
I bet you have no idea of the percentage of co2 in the atmosphere and the role of co2 in plants growing
Damn...The Matrix reorganizes....but survives
"EVERYTHING about co2 is bullshit, if you can't make taxes on the air you breath, make taxes on that you breath out.

Keep garbage and compontents like plastic and teflon etc out of the nature and we are fine."
"You, tenuously, had me until you connected it to that abysmally stupid “green new deal.” 

Honestly, a lot of what you said was correct and I was getting behind it. But you fumbled it at the one yard line by bringing that vacuous self gratifying nonsense into it.

I swear to god each time there is legislation that sounds like it could do something it gets spearheaded by the daftest and dumbest among us, and taken out behind the shed.

Maybe AOC is actually bought and paid for by oil companies to ensure that people can never get behind this argument in particular."
Ofc it is
Partial propaganda. You almost had me for a minute...
"Companies love the Citizens United ruling that identified corporations as people, mainly because it legalised political bribery.

On the other hand, now that they're pushing for ""individual responsibility"", well as people, as individuals, they are responsible for unbelievable levels of pollution. Perhaps we should actually treat them like people and visit upon them the sort of consequences any single one of us would face for such destruction."
This guy has never learned economics in his miserable self centered life
"It is telling how at he height of the pandemic when the world shut down, when cars were off the roads, when flights were cancelled or suspended @10:50, our carbon emission dropped BY LESS THAN 10%! That was a drastic, world-wide forced/involuntary suspension of carbon emitting behaviour, with huge impact on our lives, our income, our productivity, and our economy, and it ONLY reduced carbon emission by less than 10%? TEMPORARILY???
The answer to reducing carbon emission is, as the video points out, through structural change - change the way cities are designed. Change the way civic and community facilities are allocated and distributed. Change the way homes are built and clustered, and zoned. Change the way roads and communication modes are meant to serve the community. Provide real alternatives to private, single-occupant vehicles. 
It is not ""collective"" action per se that will significantly change our carbon emissions - when the world shut down in 2020 because of the pandemic, that was as ""collective"" as it can get. And it was less than 10% reduction. Temporarily. It has to be intelligent, decisive, deliberative actions to build a better system, better structures, and better real alternatives. 
And on a personal note, stop listening to Elon Musk @8:47 (cos he's a dweeb... in addition to a whole lot of other unprintable things)."
Make your donations available on YouTube. People will pay!
"Could you make a video about how the YouTube algorithm hurts leftist/progressive channels such as yours, while boosting right wingers such as Ben Shapiro and Stephen Crowder?"
"What you need is a global tax on extraction of oil and gas. It should probably start small and progressively increase until we are satisfied with the global energy production landscape. This would align the profit-maximizing objectives of the energy industry and the utility-maximizing objective of the end users with the wellfare of humanity (or at least not against it, as it is now). It might not fix the entire problem, but it would fix the vast majority of the problem.

Then we have to discuss how the tax proceeds would be used. The first idea that comes to mind is distributing it evenly to all countries proportionally to their population."
"90% sure that this full thing boils down to 'Neat concept on the surface, but under any observation, at all, its obvious that it is just big companies blaming people for their faults and making you think that is obviously correct.'. Like everything with capitalism. It fooled the world into beliving it is obviously correct."
"This is the second thought video every single Biology, AP Envorinmental Science, Environmental Science, Marine Science, and Other science teachers need to watch.
Even Mr C needs to watch this video."
ABSOLUTELY 100%
"So, according to an articel I read, apparently 70% of all the waste thrown to ecosystem is coming from 100 or so corporations. 
Lets assume the real number is 50%. So, in the best case scenerio, every individual is using nothing but sustainable/recycling stuff and throw no trash at all (Already unrealistic), 50% of the trash and waste will still thrown to the ecosystem. 
Even with rough estimates, it is a massive scam to blame just individual consumers. 

My favourite take on this is, how much carbon a jet would produce vs how much carbon would an average consumers car produce. And considering politicians, rich business man and celebrities flying with their jets all over the place, it quickly becomes painfully obvious.
Corporations are polluting tons of water per day but god forbid the poor old lady washing her 5 piece of dishes twice..."
"thanu thank u thank u thank U

SOME SANITY"
"while watching the video, I got an advertisement from linde, telling me that i could lower my carbon emissions to net zero.
This shit is so ironic."
"Or, in other words, gaslighting"
Blaming us for climate change is like blaming cavemen for the iceage
"I get it for cars and electricity, but where are the structual barriers preventing us from stop eating animals? Nobody can force us what to eat, so this is solely our consumer choice."
War on carbon... it´s one of the stupidest things ever.
"Hmmm so the consumer have the power to make the cities walkable, cyclable and have a good public transport. Thanks BP for enlightening us."
"They have turned the carbon scam into another bigger scam, which is totalitarian control using sophisticated rules by exactly those, who benefit from it, the Big Oil!"
"Great video, I did my degrees in public health and I think people get tired of me screaming about structural factors but ultimately so much of North American society is rooted in individualism and no meaningful change can happen without a drastic rapid shift to collective structural action"
"I have arguably got a carbon negative footprint... besides low power computing solutions, - I like gardening, small power-generating windmills ...and little solar panels..."
"can I vote with my money? yes, definitely, but, only me doing that is not enough! it is indeed a collective responsibility of the whole society, not just the consumers to make the right decisions!"
"I dunno, my opinion on the whole issue is the same as on blaming a patient for various health issues resulting from lifestyle choices like
diabetes, lung cancer, alcoholic liver disease etc. Blaming and finger pointing are a distraction and waste of time.  Just deal with it by starting treatment, identify the cause, and fix it, if you can. Be part of the solution and don't drag out the problem."
"love how goverments are trying to launch enviromental conscience campaings while making laws that let the corporations keep polluting the planet,"
"Nah half of the vehicles being swapped to electric by 2040 wont happen. There isint enough lithium or cobalt in the world to electrify even the commercial light vehicles (not the heavy trucking) of delivery, cleaners etc that use passenger cars and vans to move, let alone private car ownership and more over currently EV is comparably too expensive to say diesel, even when most of its battery material are mined with child and slave labor, processed with out any environmental protections in China. Change that production to western labor and environmental protection laws and price of EV jumps two fold. Dead battery after 10 years? Thats 40K minimum instead of current 20K that is impossibility to middle to low income families to pay and getting new one is the same, even if recycling companies would start to pay same amount of lithium than whats scrap copper costs now. Tesla battery hold 5-75kg of lithium in it, so if scrap copper value is 5.60 €/kg thats just 28- 420€ in scrap lithium. Combine that with scrap copper and gold etc valuable metals you maybe get 1000€ in all for scrap EV in this theoretical price, though now days you might have to pay to dispose that ev battery so its like buying a bomb when you get EV as low to middle income family, even if you could afford used one in the first place. That whole sum goes down the drain moment EV dies. You might get couple grand out in spare parts that are still working, but its such a shitty investment that it pales in comparison modern car, hence people still drive trusty old cars that you can work your self and get it working with baling wire and welder most of the time.

Best possible choice for environment is old mechanical diesel engine you can put pretty much any oil including biological oils in it after processing that can be done at home, where new diesels just get clogged injectors, being designed not to run on that. Also exotic parts that are hard to impossible to manufacture your self after manufacturer stops providing spares and scrappers have sold out all the used spares.
This is why we need to stop being consumers and be customers again. Buy old vehicles, build business around repairing them to keep those reliable vehicles at the road and demand both government and corporations to start producing simplified reliable vehicles that can run pretty much any diesel fuel, instead of what is going on now, of vilifying diesel as the great evil and trying to ban it more than gasoline or wood gas vehicles, witch are also option depending your life style and can be built to be ecological and environmentally friendly, but we all know.. this was never about the environment, but control and power.

Also this same thing applies to everything. Repair instead of buying new, since that grandpas lawnmower will probably outlast you if its maintained properly.. the new one probably gives out in decade if not less since its cheaply made and uses parts you cant really manufacture your self or locally in reasonable price. Also learn the skills to do these repairs, its infinitely cheaper well as works as therapy to wrench something on your own. Build communities around repairing and learn new skills. That is the way to go. For living... GET OUT OF THE CITIES. It does not have to be far but outside you have more resources on your door step well as ability to grow your own food least partially. Now that is the green move to make, witch we have grown away from. Most moronic of us dont even understand that electricity does not come just from the wall with money and food does not come from the store."
If only there were an ideology that could influence the government to dismantle the biggest polluters 🤔🤔
"When it comes to any other unwanted effect or behavior you would aim to remove the root problem,  aim to disrupt it further up the chain. 
For illegal drugs you would shut down the known drug lab rather than all the consumers. Even better to bring down the cartel."
"Wow, youtube blue boxed this even though nobody clicks it or really cares what they have to say about it. Crazy."
Fr. Crazy how the government try to push the cost of fixing climate change on normal people by increasing our taxes and adding costs for using diesel cars meanwhile 1 cargo container burns as much fuel as millions of cars and the big companies don’t have to follow any laws
Exxon should be on trial at Hague.
"In democracies there is no chance to change. Even lowering the speed limit to save fuel (and save lives by the way) is heavily resisted by the majority. Or changing to a max vehicle size say the size of a Honda civic, including not using big trucks at all and switching to rail transport. Voters would say no thanks."
This generation actin like the climate hasn't always changed lol virtue signalling fecks
"I despise when ads play on your videos because I know YouTube isn't paying you for them, but is still trying to milk your viewership."
thank you for making me realize
In this day and age we need GLOBAL collective action...
"I'm at the University of Toronto right now finishing the last year of my political science undergrad. One concept which has come up a lot this year (especially in my collective action class) is co-optation. I've become much more familiar with the term than I was before this school year. It has become much more clear to me how often co-optation of terms, ideas and movements is within our society. The use of the term ""carbon footprint"" by BP could be seen as co-optation and from BP's perspective, a good idea. Recognize the issue, but do nothing themselves to work towards solving the issue."
"Already aware of this topic, but more people have to become aware of it 

Important takeawy point is, that personal responsablility is still important. Just because the personal impact is miniscule, throwing away trash into the landscape, overconsumption like fast fashion are still bad for the world. But the change needs to happen on a global, strucal level.

We need 100% renewable energy,  otherwise everthing else we do like changing to electric cars  is not enough. Especially NA need more public transport, better zoning laws so a less car dependant life is possible, but also more responsable use of ressources. The extensive use of the water from the Colorado river is a prime example of overusing our natural ressources"
Ride Bikes. Cars are killing us.
I'm sort of loving the subtle humor used more in recent videos
"They are not wrong and you can't look at it as ""individual consumers"" if the majority of the population did minor things to reduce pollution it would make a HUGE impact. 

Humans eat tons of meat which leads to slaughter houses with tons of cows tooting all day. This is greenhouse gasses caused by us and just one of them. We are all at fault here not just the major corporations. Yes, they play a bigger role but we all as the human race have an issue as well and not just black and white.

Making this topic about just you severely down plays the major problems and one of my pet peeves. Am I wrong to say this is no different then anti masters talking about their ""individual "" rights? See? Just like the pandemic it's not about the individual; and those that think so make you want to scream right?! This is the same-exact-thing."
"We need to make sure, our hands, we need collective action, we we we.. individual bad, we good. I am we. Give me das powaa!"
"Nah I try to minimize my carbon footprint, and straight up its just bc I care more than someone who doesn’t. You don’t have to do something because everyone else is ie eating meat driving cars. I’m not trying to push any belief about whether it’s wrong to do those things (it’s not). Just saying though you can still choose to care, and if you don’t want to go out of your way to act about it you can’t expect your politicians to either."
Renewable energy isn't the the solution. Be like France and invest in nuclear power. Nuclear is the solution. It also isn't harmful for wildlife unlike solar and wind.
I wonder if we can apply the same logic to veganism when it is done as a way to stop factory farming and the likes.
"You cant talk about personal carbon footprint as long as you are referring only to one continent ...
Its counterproductive to implement taxes about it in north america and europe while nobody else does it or cares about it 🥱🥱
  Its either a global effort or not.
  And by the way things are looking now, its almost  impossible for a global effort to be made in this direction. 
How can we afford to pay tax on personal carbon footprins while we still havent figured out world hunger poverty etc...🙄🙄"
Those of us who did not have children should get credit for the consumption which we did not contribute to. Think about it as all those who will not use anything or pollute anything and the following generations that would continue indefinitely. I am from a catholic family so my credit would be huge if I had chosen to follow their lead. I should be rich if there are carbon credits. This really is a corporate scam!
"Hi, what's the point of the video? I understand that carbon foot print is to make people decide what they consume so the producer of polluting goods adapt to more friendly ecological methods and process in production Still, people are brainwashed  on a regular basis, it starts from a birth until the day the life ends
And man! ""a collective decision"" if such thing existed their wouldn't be a governement, ONG or any organisation, the carbon foot print is a myth, the real danger are the products that connot be recycled such as ""plastic, and harmful chimicals, etc"" 
They are simply making people take responsibility for somthing they dont have any control on it, remember the brainwash, it make people go depressed and feel they are cancer on earth, when other people are cashing on this attitude selling them drung that are not ecofriendly!
Take the Ohio incident, spreading  chemicals and bruning them at the end of the process, as a mean of eliminating them is a crime to nature, we didn't evolve to a real ecofriendly source of energy, because simply patent are not allowing other technologies to take place and be mass produced!
Simply put, a big growns gigantic smelly greedy monster has taken control of humanity, we are in a deep dark era where no one can do anything, even eco violence is meaningless, moreover harmful, and the pleague years made it clear we people are not in charge of anything, but to selfharm our psychie and feel passively bad for what is happening!"
Conservatives have a disturbing fixation with blaming problems on people with the least amount of power and influence.
I tried to explain to my mother-in-law that recycling was a scam invented by plastic companies; she got mad and said that it sounds like I am just trying to weasel out of my responsibility to the Earth...
"apparently if everyone lived like me we'd need 7 earths. according to that quizz.

Weird cause if everyone were like me I'm pretty sure we'd establish communism with the planets health as one of our primary concerns."

"""Gas lighting"" by big oil is only exceeded by gas lighting by catastrophists.  History is the best lesson. We haven't exceeded any weather norms and claiming otherwise IS gaslighting."
"most of that ""co2 equivalent polution"" is from coal powerplants, which they refuse to upgrade to LITERALLY ANY OTHER POWERPLANT because they wouldnt get instant profit"

Why can’t we understand that as a race the same way we progress we also damage if we get to mars we will also mess it up it’s in our dna  global warming is our doom. Look at the core of the earth it’s hotter then the sun we have exploited our fossil fuel guess what that oil mantle is what protects us from the core and the more we extract the hotter it gets we are idiots. Everything is in place for a reason. But not is to late

I doubt the oceans stand still long enough for that to even be a possibility.🤣 And how are they able to specifically attribute that percentage to glaciers melting???  What exactly is the formula for calculating that???  
To think that mankind is capable of controlling what the planet Earth does is LUDICROUS at best.  Water, fire, cold, heat, wind, lava, etc... kicks our ass easily all the time and we have yet to find a way of stopping it. People need to live their best life and stop worrying about this ridiculous ""climate change"" nonsense and always remember that we are but one volcanic eruption away from the next mass extinction ice age which could happen any minute and we are powerless to do anything about it!
  Notice how they stopped referring to the so-called environmental crisis as ""global warming"" and now label it as ""climate change"" because global warming doesn't always apply but climate change generally covers any conditions that might occur!  So now, no matter what happens, it's still always an ""ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS"" and they never have to worry about getting it wrong!!! I think most people would be hard pressed to consider ""climate change"" as a man made crisis since it IS known to be something that happens naturally, on the daily, REGARDLESS."
Could it be the active volcanos under the ice caps causing this
All I have to say about climate change is that if the American democrats are worried about it and want money for it then it is pure bullcrap just like everything else they have on their agenda. Just like Trudeau take more money from the taxpayers thinking that one of the cleanest countries will make a change. Maybe try getting the money from the top polluters instead from the places that have made changes
its a normal phenom . . . and has nothing to do with climate change that which is hoax.

"Global warming for dummies:
CO2 is 0.04% of the atmosphere.
It means for every 100 molecules in the atmosphere there are 0,04 molecules of CO2
Now multiply both values by a 100. Then we get:
For every 10000 molecules in the atmosphere there are 4 molecules of CO2.
One of these 4 CO2 molecules was added by humans.
It means that for every 10000 molecules in the atmosphere only 1 CO2 molecule was because of humans.
Do you really think that this 1 CO2 molecule out of 10000 molecules is causing global warming? No.
You do not have to be scientist to understand this.
Why would one molecule out of 10000 take over the climate?"
I would like to see you talk about the fishing nets that are responsible for almost 50% of the garbage in our oceans.
Ffs fix this shit people. It is really fucking hot. We need to make a change!
This has already happened so many times throughout Earth's history. There are cities submerged a hundred feet below the sea level from a couple thousand years ago. It happens we are just along for the ride. If people actually cared about climate change they wouldn't make the little person suffer instead they would stop Flying their private jets around the world just to get a burger in France because it's better than the ones they make in New York. The rich class is the problem here not everybody else

This is a natural cycle the earth goes through. This is going to happen again and again.
This is beginning of the end

Cavemen started global warming during the last ice age about 10 thousand years back.
gargantuan ball in the sky causes fluctuation in global temperature
Too many ultrarich people stand to lose a lot of money if this 'global warming' all of a sudden gets debunked by some of the 98% climate soothsayers.
"She is correct, we have the data, it's is in the ice sheets. climate is cyclic about 23,000 years. We are currently 11,000 years into this cycle."
It's good that she at least acknowledges climate change is occurring.  Interesting fact 97% of climate scientists agree climate change is occurring due to human activity....fact.
"I am a conservative.  climate modeling is difficult and we are not that good at it.  The pressing problem I believe is anthropomorphic release of CO2 (human ).  In my very simple research, (anyone can do this in less than an hour) I looked up the combustion byproducts of combustion gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel.  This is simple chemistry and it is easy to find several sources on this chemistry so as to get a precise answer.  It is also easy to look up how much fuel is burned world wide and what is the human tolerance for breathing CO2.  
 When you do this you will come up with the uncomfortable conclusion that global warming may not be the most pressing concern for humans living on earth.  It might be CO2 content.  good for plants, but bad for you.  
I expected to find a different truth.  I expected to find that the science had been distorted in the news.  Climate change might be certainly, but Human release (anthropomorphic) of CO2 is rising at an alarming and exponential rate since 1700.  (Looked up in studies of ICE CoRES)   It was 277ppm (parts per million) in 1700, 300ppm in 1900 and 400ppm in 2010.  The maximum safe level is said to be at 400.  
The Good thing is that we are changing to electric cars and solar energy.  And good for the the countries that make these items :-)
Let me know what you think?"
"Global warming is a result of the suns activity and not anything to do with
human activity. Is the globe still warming? The sun's activity has
reduced and many climatologists and scientists are predicting a
cooling period, even a mini ice age. If that is true we will require
as much Co2 as possible to avoid crop failures.  The
whole issue of carbon emissions and climate change is about money and the pension funds
that greedy corporations and banks wish to mobilise."
Because of the IPCC we are placing all our eggs in one basket.
"Not to mention that any warming would be a good thing, not a bad thing."
"Many people who are believers in the standard AGW meme will say ""so 97% of scientists are corrupt, are they?"" as if any other view must come from kooky  fringe conspiracy theorists. But Prof. Curry here hits the nail on the head. Science is financed largely in order to achieve political ends. So it is he who holds the purse who's ""science"" is validated."
Tucker = Truth. Please investigate the recent UFO documents implicating Admiral Wilson.
Finally someone tells the truth. Academics need a entertaining special earth changing outcome of their research in order to get attention and more financing.. There reseach can't just be inconclusive.
This illustrates why running schools based on an ideology is an absolutely terrible idea it puts blinders on your reasoning.
It’s been warming since the ice melted in New York. Remember it was under ice a few years back before humans LOL. Why don’t they do real research. Good for her. You know we are moving into a Solar minimum which will cause cooling. Get your wool sweaters out. (Natural not synthetic oil made).

"When true scientist leave the faculty and activists come in, this is the end of university science. IPCC deciples prepare for a total loss of crediblity and a complete destruction of science. Congratulations, you tossed american science in the garbage for the next 50 years."
"Politics doesn't belong in science, it warps the narrative and corrupts the data. those scientists who are activists should be ashamed of calling themselves scientists when they're actually a bunch of witch doctors ."
I like Ms. Judith Curry - follow the science - follow the facts - NOT the politics. Good for her. There should be more researchers like her.
Let's not search for and find the root of the problem. Let's form the plastic straw police that'll solve the problem.
"This reminds me of Martin Luther and the 95 theses or Copernicus. This isn't science-based it's ""Dogmatic"""
Natural climate variability is irrelevant.
Fact is there is NO clear indicators to suggest global warming is a serious issue! This is nothing more than a ploy to lie to people for financial gain and to push a political agenda!
Thank god for a good scientist to come out and tell the truth that the  data really isn't there .for the record the earth was warmer  by 2 degrees in 19 22 and the Co2  was over 300 ppm  the facts are there.
Notice the YouTube propaganda below any video regarding climate change

Don’t quit. Fight!
It's a scam for GOVERNMENTS to tax you even more whatever country you stay in...the only guy with balls is Donald Trump who dumped the paris agreement quite rightly so...all these pricks that dont want YOU to have car...is because they don't have one...another tax on the poor..it wont affect the rich they will still fly on their holidays..all the MP'S it wont affect them either...dont do as I do do as I say...dont eat this food..dont eat that food while they stuff  anything into their guts...
"Well, it looks like Georgia Tech faculty just got a little more stupid with the loss of this Professor."
"Tucker it's simple. What's happening is natural and not dangerous for human beings. CO2 is food for Trees and plants and it's at the lowest it's ever been say a number of scientists. Invite Viscount Christopher Monckton or Viscount Matt Ridley and they will explain that global warming is a hoax! In fact you could ask the expert Jim Lee Climate Viewer, about the Technology for Weather Modification. There is a technology to cool down the weather but then the WMO could not have their Treaties signed by various countries and have practical totalitarian power, which is what that Pyramid of Control is seeking to gain. cp"
"Climate always changes. 
No matter how much money you throw at it you will never stop it."
"Stay strong, the people are with you. You are TOO intelligent for that university and have morals. God Bless you :)"
"The grand solar minimum is having a huge effect. In the middle ages, the climate warmed up for a long time, then BAM mini ice age. I don't think humans had anything to do with that. These aren't scientists, they are just in these fields to make money."
"She's spot on. There's no denying that CO2 can cause warming, but the truth of it is, not to the extent that they claim, and that group is the very one which is pushing for a carbon tax. Others in science know better, and know that the warming is mostly just a natural occurrence. Let us see what happens if the government gives out some money to science to disprove the theory of the first group. It is hard to deny that we have had two little ice ages, along with the Holocene Maximum warming, and another around 7,000 BCE. In fact, as time goes on, these fluctuations get shorter in span. Another fact is that as ice melts in the north, it is gained in the south.

http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/bronze/climate.htm

Notice that they call today the ""industrial age global warming,"" which does not mean it has to do with industry causing it, but that it happened during the industrial age. Also, they have found that during some of the cool periods, that CO2 was much higher than now."
"Climate change is natural. If You hate what Humans are doing to the World, you are most likely a hypocrite"
Go plant a tree. Go plant 2 trees and shut up.
"This has become a polarized religious issue much like ""choice"" where one rationally just follows the government power-money trail, and if the pundits don't have answers, they just make them up....or doctor the data."

"duh how come these people don't watch the sun, the most significant energy source in the solar system? don't you think sun cycles and changes in its energy output affects earth's climate and warming or cooling?"
"Professor Curry says,  ""The Climate has been warming for several hundred years.""  Uhhhh....I don't think so.  The 400 years of ""The Little Ice Age"" only ended about 1876...the year Custer got into trouble on the Little Big Horn.  FYI...The cold temps of the Little Ice Age caused the deaths of more than 65 million people worldwide....Largely due to crop failure and illness caused by the low temperatures.  Note; the Little Ice Age was preceded by,  The Medieval Warm Period, which lasted about 325 years.  Gee...There were actually several periods of warming and cooling since the most recent ICE AGE ended it's  2.6 million years of  frozen hell about 11,000 years ago.  

Don't people read anymore?"

"I was in college during the 70s; back then it was ""Global Cooling""...just relax everybody, the world is OK."
It's funny that Youtube puts a Wikipedia link directly below this video on Global Warming. Just shows how much liberals hate it when others don't go along with the group think radical left.
"@YouTube  get rid of the Mommy/Daddy ""Context""  if any human with cognitive agility is reading this, @YouTube doesn't know jack-squat about ""Climate"" or climatology."

Humans have actually been saving the climate and its environment by releasing carbon into the atmosphere.
"If researchers are being skewed in one direction or another by politics, money or by their employer, then it’s hard to make a case that unbiased, credible conclusions are being reached on climate change.  This gives new meaning to the term ‘political science’.  We might as well ignore all this climate stuff until they get the politics out of science."

Don't worry. She just decided it's time to cash in a work for an oil company. She just wants the freedom to ignore evidence. Poor lady.
I don’t agree that it is warming.
Solar minimum get ready for the ice age.
"And how much carbon dioxide (which incidentally is not a pollutant) does the world's vegetation pull out of the atmosphere?  If you are to be taken seriously then you must have an answer to this question, moreover, an answer which is supportable by actual data."
"I'm not a scientist and I KNOW human activity is not the main cause of climate change. I also think that any intelligent person should know that the suns' cycle is responsible for climate change. I also KNOW that of all the greenhouse gasses water vapour  is the major contributing factor as well as cloud cover. And anyone with a brain should know that CO2 IS ESSENTIAL FOR PLANT LIFE WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR OXYGEN PRODUCTION AND FOOD WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXISTENCE!! JUST LOOKING AT THE PERCENTAGE OF CO2 IN THE ATMOSPHERE 400 PPM SHOULD MAKE PEOPLE REALIZE   IT'S INSIGNIFICANCE IN CONTROLLING ANYTHING. AND HUMANS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR 
0.03% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CO2. NOW WAKE-UP PEOPLE YOU'RE BEING LIED TO AS USUAL. WHEN ARE PEOPLE GOING TO LEARN!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

(The Phoenix Islands)  I have been studying that island (re Amelia Earhart) for years now. The water level has not changed. I have been going to my local beach in Australia for over 75 years now and the beach is still as wide as it ever was. No water encroachment on the land."
about time we heard from both sides I hate how anyone is vilified if they ask for information
Climate Scientists should not be activists.  If they are crazy activists they should be fired. We need level headed scientists not activists.
I think this woman is very sensible - she agrees that the climate is changing but is not convinced that humans are the major cause - my thoughts exactly.
"I thought warming started after the

driving around back then & yet it just started.
It's called, ""Climate"". End of story."
Only idiots do kot believe in global warming
"Global Climate change is REAL!!!   Every summer it gets hot, and every winter it gets cold.  Coincidence?  I think not.  Everyone knows that it all started when the dinosaurs invented the SUV and started polluting the ozone layer with jet trail vapor exhaust.  This is the undeniable truth and any who dispute it are stoopid poopie heads."
Climate change phenomena is in truth a way to control the masses.  Bankrupt the country and the the government takes care of the population.  The bingo socialism enforced and we then will turn into Venezuela

Its not hard to see which way these people will go. Its not like they can get a job anywhere else...."
Climatism shall meet its demise. Surprised how long this cult continues to foster. Thankfully the Eddy Minimum ruins their hysteria.
"""Climate change"" is so obviously a nefarious scheme by the globalists to push for open borders .. for christs sake the UN was predicting disaster by year 2000 in 1989!"

King James Version

And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh."
Climate change is a money maker organization yo😂😂😂
"Kill people and kill nature

Poor are looting"
This channel is owned by a an absolute monarchy (Qatar) who btw owns (qatar petroleum) the 3rd largest oil and gas reserves in the world  ...there should be something fishy about their channel prmoting this climate change narrative  like maybe theyre feeding you half truths and half lies....and the USA is the least contributor of pollution in the world its facts. look it up.
"Allah/Hashem /God ( The One True Creator) has warned mankind about the extinction (kiyamat) in the Holy Quran and sent messengers from time to time to warn people so that repent and live a righteous life in their predetermined lifetime.

What is the solution pls discuss solutions pls
thanks
"If all the people that really believes that the temperature rises because of the CO2 emission, start to follow the advices of the experts, I think we should manage to get this problem under control.
The people that does not believe it, may then go on driving their cars, flying around the world and continue to eat meat.
It is in a way unjust if people that does not  believe such theories should  be forced to do certain things because other people thnk they should."
"CO2 represents 0.04% of our atmosphere. Three years ago it was at 433 ppm. Today it’s at 419 ppm. If CO2 falls below 225 ppm, all life on planet earth will die. CO2 is plant food. Well, carbon is. Plants extract carbon from CO2 and 'exhale' oxygen. Which is good for you.
* Plant life flourishes at 3X the current atmospheric CO2 levels. Commercial greenhouses routinely raise CO2 to 0.1% to 0.12%. Search 'CO2 generators'.
* When plant life flourishes, ALL life flourishes, including you.
* You learned this in Middle School Science. Search 'Carbon Cycle'."
It is happening faster than we can mange and will get far worse than we can imagine. Unfortunately natural cycles will need crash that our civilization can not handle. And then we have to hope we haven't wreck any chance of recovery.
"Here is the solution, especially if you're living in a rich country: Consume less!

I reduced my personal carbon footprint by 70% by changing my lifestyle. Can you do the same? 
1. For 3 years I've been a vegetarian.
2. In 2019, I didn't travel by airplane. I won't in 2020 either. It's an addiction, even I LOVE to travel by plane.
3. I ditched my gasoline car for an electric car that I travel with instead of the Airplane-trips. A trip from Norway to the south of Spain for a family of 4 is 14000 times more polluted if you travel by airplane than if you're going with your electric car. The best thing to do is to not go at all. 
4. In 2019 I didn't buy any clothes. In 2020 I bought the clothes I need for all of this year. 
5. I moved my family from a big house to an apartment 1/3 the size.  
6. Voting for the politicians who are the most environmentally friendly. 

I'm always amazed to speak to my friends who travel frequently around the world, they eat meat multiple times per week, never thinking of their impact. 
It is as if the global warming issue is only up to politicians to fix, but the politicians are more concerned about their own survival in the political game. Why is it so cheap to do the most pollutive actions, such as flying? Money speaks, unfortunately. 
Also, most climate influencers are hypocritical with their HUGE personal footprints. 

As David Attenborough said: ""We can't go on saying 'but there's hope' and leave it to next year""

Disclaimer: All of the above may seem like bragging. Normally, I would not speak out loud about things like this. I wrote it still, as we need to hurry up. I'd love to travel more by plane, eat meat, buy whatever I want etc. like I used to. Can't justify it. Not anymore."
So just block the sun with thousands of planes expelling a mixture of nanoparticles of metals to reflect the sun. Do this daily.

It’s not “global warming” anymore. They now call it “climate change” because that’s a better catch all term for the political football the issue has become. Maybe China and India should start pulling their weight and stop polluting the environment.
FUN FACT: Highest per capita carbon emitter: Qatar
"So rather than failing and hiding behind sham, when will the president of the USA, the GOP, the Koch Bros and fossil fuel companies apologise for their climate change denial mental illness?"
Individuals can not make the change. Government and companies must make it to have any impact.
Hot regions getting hotter cold regions getting colder ....wet reasons getting wetter
Actually I don't have a problem with it being too hot I like the sunlight anyway
"Cause of fossil fuel, from developed industrial countries 🇺🇸🇦🇨🇨🇦"
It's so sad and serious. People who don't believe in climate change because of our own pollution are blind and uneducated. And now some reality t.v. dude became president and dosen't belive in it? Danger! 🖕trump🖕
Joe Biden shut down almost all the coal mines in America even though we can have clean burning coal power plants and then we sell all the code to China in their dirty 1950s power plants
Would be great if you guys left references in the description box.
"What is the cause of climate change and how can it be solved?
Many people think that the cause of climate change is carbon dioxide, and reducing carbon dioxide can prevent climate change.
This is a bit convincing, but not correct.
The exact cause of climate change is ""thermal excess"" on the earth.
Therefore, to stop climate change, we must focus on stopping of the ""thermal excess"".

""GREEN NEW DEAL"" has good intentions. However, there are several problems. 
The biggest problem is that it is less economical. It means that it is difficult for many people to actively participate. 
Therefore, coercion must be mobilized to achieve the desired goal, and excessive coercion hinders the achievement of the goal. 
This is a fundamental problem.
Also, waste is another problem. 
Waste solar cells and waste blades are discharged, and the waste batteries of ESS adversely affect the environment.

Although there is a problem with the need for large land, the best way to reduce heat and carbon dioxide is to create big forests.
Trump should publicize the effects of ""One trillion trees"" to others and urge the world to join in and work together.

Why is ""One trillion trees"" so effective?
First of all, it is economical. Compared to solar power generation and wind power generation, it does not require a lot of funds at the beginning. 
forests has a long lifespan, and does not require additional facilities such as ESS and power transmission and distribution facilities, and does not emit waste.

In addition, One trillion trees absorb enormous amounts of solar heat.
Photosynthesis requires infrared rays from the sun.
It absorbs infrared rays (heat rays) and ultraviolet rays to perform photosynthesis, turning carbon dioxide into oxygen and making glucose.
One trillion trees absorbing solar heat is very good at slowing down climate change. 
The reason people don't really care about trees absorbing heat is that they don't think the cause of global warming is fundamentally ""overheating,"" but rather carbon dioxide.

How can you get a lot of land? We have to use the desert.
But how to supply a huge amount of water? 
This is a solution --> @.

Its all because to much human💩💩💩.Just pack in a rocket send to planet Mars.
"Climate change is total bullshit.. All natural disaster was made by God, whatever change in the eco system has nothing to do with human activity"
Climate change concept is a biggest scam in order to control developing nations development. COUNTRIES like USA Sweden Canada all developed countries are producing alot of waste and in return want others to stop their development. Nothing is going to happen.
To every action there is equal or opposite reaction. Human kill human. Nature is God

"Paris agreement... oh my!  As stated countries 'set their own' pledges for emissions. The US was currently already beating nearly all nations with their pledges. And these were 'pledges', with no consequence for inaction.  What a stupid idea. Or like countries still trying to pull out of poverty are going to saddle their countries with new world energy compliances that made them the powerhouses they are now in the 1st place. Or the idea that all this 'renewable' energy such as windmills and batteries are magic and don't require old dirty means of manufacturing to make those products. Yeah sure guys, the batteries you need grow on battery trees and don't come from mines and old school means of creation. Has the earth as a whole 'warmed' to the tune of 1-1.25 degrees Celsius over the last 100 years. Pretty clear by science it has, as it also had for the over 8 100 year cycles before that (also not heavily science debated). The issue is the impact of man on this change, and I think its an honest debate despite social media saying otherwise. CO2 increases, as in the chart shown here, usually have followed an inverse in global temps (not shown here). I think that is at least important to note. Am I a 'climate denial freak?' No. Looking at the science the earth is warming. Am I a 'climate alarmist?' Also no. I can't find evidence in the data that is currently touted about how we are doomed without immediate action. Despite what videos I watch that neatly tell me to panic in a nice under 8 minute montage."
"Yes, the climate is changing, but the reason for that is not CO2. This is a lie spread by the IPCC, because it investigates only one side of the story. The reason is much deeper and comes, apparently, from the galactic influences that periodically occur on Earth. The proof that this is not the work of man is that changes are observed on other planets of the solar system and on the Sun itself. Glaciers are melting but not because of air temperature, but under the influence of magma coming from the interior of the planet. Glaciers are melting from below. Etc."
"1:12 ""We have been burning more and more fossil fuels"" (while severely reducing the number of trees/forests, and so diminishing the capacity to catch all the excess CO2)."
Talking only
"Climate change = c.c. = 33 
Let that be wisdom"
The people who are interesting in this subject very little - need to make extra efforts
The farming food mr. Robot cow level 1 earth recycle😕
It would have been such a great video if your were to made it clear on what things we can start doing so some of us can have an idea not just left clueless and anxious 😭
me who has subtitles on and is using it to write my essay :)
Magnificent effort👍
"Climate change started by Al Gore in the 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth.  H3 said the ice caps would be gone by now - they have grown - and Polars bears would all be drowned.  There are more Polar bears today than in 2006.  Sea water has not grown an inch.  They take measurements where tectonic plates are shrinking and not growing.  The Islands you are talking about are on falling tectonic plates.  Look up the facts you freak.  Look up freak and tell me that is not you.  By the way Al Gores Ranch uses $30,000 dollars a year to run in energy.  I am fed up with rich elite freaks telling me to use less oil when they use thousands of times more than me.  I have been abroad once in 10 years.  If you have been abroad more then that then shut your mouth."
lock down is the key to minimize the use of the transportation
But can’t we adapt like the Netherlands did to take back land from the ocean. Or a Venice building a city on top of the water.
It is okay for the Earth to get warmer regardless of speed? Really?
Stop producing the obscene quantities of beef lamb poultry @ all livestock raised  to feed our own nation @  export overseas.Australia may have been built upon the sheep's back but it's time to overhaul  the primary industry @ the standards @ practises which have allowed it to produce more meat than the nation requires to feed itself and export beyond that. How we treat the most vulnerable on the planet THE ANIMALS  IS  the proof @  measure of our humanity.BAN LIVE EXPORT @ PROSECUTE  AS A CRIME CARRYING  INCACERATION AND  FINANCIAL  RESTITUTION FOR BREAKING THE LAW . AND IMPOSE THE LAW.Australia cannot be complacent   anything  less than vigilant is barbaric @ ultimately economically unsustainable.🐎🐎🐎🦘🦘🦘🐨🐨🐨
Herd all this rubbish twenty years ago the temperature hasn't risen only the stupidity of people who believe garbage like this
"Climate Change is the name given to the scheme to make the rich richer by taking away from the poor and working classes things like affordable energy, homes, transportation. Ever notice how Eco-Friendly technology costs twice as much and performs half as well? Being a Climate Change Activist is a luxury for the rich, and a liability for the  poor and working classes. How many of you can afford a YACHT (made mostly from petroleum based products) to sail around the world and brag about how self-righteous you are?"
is red meat also bad
Rise up. Hold the corrupt accountable. May Allah help us. 🤲🏼❤️🌱
"First of all, accept the fact that human made climate change is real
It is not in the future..it is happening right now in front of you"
Pity you guys can never say who the scientists are that push the climate change agenda. Most of the graphs I have seen are false
I like the way she speaks and presents.
pakistan is planting 1 billion trees.
"... love this comment section.
Can't believe they left it open."
"Science and politics is playing game's to get more money... nothing else..
The sky is built by God to handle the waste fumes and.gasses...so is the sea is built to handle all the filth through river's...same as the earth... God built this world perfectly.. science can't build an earth..but science is harming it... though..but it's being controlled by God..that explains the flood's..washes the filth...snow...hail.. this is a trick to Go against oil rich producing countries..."
"Propaganda=Climate Change
Reality= Weather Warfare. Geoengineering."
"Global warming just like increased co2 levels are only beneficial for a greener earth and the biodiversity of our planet.
Climate scientists in the past made all sorts of predictions from which we now know they never came true.
Misinformation that was used in All Gore's movie "" An Inconvenient truth"" of which the untruthfulness is increasingly coming out with every failed prediction made in it.
The real problem to me is the ongoing deforestation and concreting of the earth's land mass, co2 is not a pollutant for life on earth in quantities that have been proven to sustain the most abundant presence of life in history.
Of course when there are not enough trees and other greenery left to absorb co2 than we have a problem.
A international group of governments are making the people believe that the levels of co2 are too high instead of the levels of concrete, I say the levels of trees are too low.
Instead of lowering our emissions of the building blocks of life we should increase the level of green plants."
"""Climate change"" is a tool for establishing world government. Period."
Volcanoes 🌋 literally do not care about your electric car
"This is an excellent video of morons supporting stupidity.

How does longer wave radiation increase the temperatures of shorter wave radiation?"
"Stop talking about CO² 
Start talking about ALL the other greenhouse gases.
CO² is one of the least damaging greenhouse gases.
(Still damaging...)
But let's be honest... There's been A LOT more going into the atmosphere since humans started burning fossil fuels than just massive amounts of carbon dioxide.

What about all the methane for starters?
In all the time we were burning coal and solid fuels...you think caron dioxide is the worst thing released in those processes?

The *""industrial revolution""* wasn't just the beginning of humans pumping massive amounts of gas and particulate into the atmosphere... We also dumped the waste byproducts into rivers and lakes and oceans and buried it in the ground in the hope that out of sight meant not just out of mind...but also GONE entirely as a problem.

We talk now about CO² emissions acidifying oceans...
Come the fu©k on...
When we discuss weather prediction...do we ONLY talk about water vapor? Or are there other factors to consider?"
👍👍👍
Nice video watching in geography loving life
Climate change is called EVOLUTION. Nothing else.
Climate change is when your stuck watching stupid Ads
India opened coal industry to private players. Is that called awareness?
"with CO2 & Methane levels still rising. and we are targeted to hit 1.5 degrees above by 2030? You can only expect that to speed up, the rise in temperature that is. And we will probably hit 2 degrees by 2035. Maybe 2050 at the latest.  Not 2100! You can keep throwing more fuel on the fire and NOT expect it to turn into a raging inferno, FASTER!"
Climate change is a big hoax..
We are not live on that time so why we are warry
"thousands of acres of solar farms, instead of crops??
 in canada, we have winter 6 months of the year.
  global warming??       Bring it on !!"
1950...2022 use decomped materials and cultivate the lands....
"its the end of world as we know it, its the end of the world as we know it but I feel fine!"
Ironic thing is that Qatar is the largest polluter (per capita) on Earth.
A HOAX
It's just more propaganda to make us pay for something that's all BS!!!
These days having time to read educational books or articles is becoming more difficult. But thanks to DW  I am reading several books and articles in a single documentary. Thanks.
Unfortunately it will take decades... Time we do not have...
"Wind turbines only last 25 years. Afterwards they bury the blades because, as they're made of fiberglass, they CANNOT be recycled. 

They also REQUIRE petroleum based products in order to run efficiently. They're made in factories that run off carbon emitting power plants ran either by coal, natural gas, or nuclear, none of which are environmentally safe."
"Not going to beat anything especially climate change.
It has been underway for 150 years."
Yes..especially with upcoming new technology !
"very educative documentary, the space solar arrays is quite interesting, its my first time hearing about principal of operation, it would be interesting how it turns out."
Can turbines be turned in space ? Do they need to be so big ? Are solar cells inefficient or too thin layered ? Could we save energy by having lower energy appliances work with a wireless energy hub. Like can a radio wave power a mini turbine to power a device battery. I heard a TV can run on an aa battery ?
"Will we be able to mine, haul and founder the steel and other metals with turbines to rebuild the turbines?"
"Excellent insight into the technological innovations we're moving towards in green energy, but having an energy beacon in space is something of SciFi and is so insane to think about"
"DW: California is not like the rest of America 
The Rest of America: 😂😂😂 THANK GOD"
300 GW of wind doesn't generate the same energy as 300 GW of nuclear or thermal power plant 9:30 . The load factor is around 40% for wind turbines amd thermal and nuclear is close to 85%-90%
"As long as planned obsolescence isn't a default process. Also, sustainable > renewable"

There's no crisis. This is a tool so they can push the reset. It's an excuse to take away freedoms from the majority of the population.
DW fluctuate between hard journalism then every so often get some alphabet mafia climate change ideologue stuff
❤❤
not even close.
"There is no climate crisis! That is a scam, a new way to drive people into poverty, buying solar panels and crappy electric cars"
There is no climate crisis.
"DW, when you discuss this subject, how come you don't look into Professor Simon Michaux's work on the subject?.. 🤔🧐"
Nope. Also people forget we are in ending of ice.
"I have a idea to produce electricity,  i believe this process should work if you want only then i can share??"
"There is no ""climate crisis"", there is a perception crisis. These cycles are 100% natural. Co2 is completely offset by plants, as designed by nature, and our co2 levels have fallen BELOW optimal levels for plant growth. We are merely at the end of an ice age. The earth has been much, much hotter than it is right now many times before. To wage a war on carbon, is to wage a war on carbon based lifeforms."
Is there a climate crisis?
Renewable will work 5 to 10 years from now
No they will not renewable power causes more so called greenhouse gases then using coal and oil
"The entire supposition is a farce. Humans have little impact on climate. It was warmer 1000 years ago. Greenland was half green; it isn't now.  England was producing more and better grapes than france - how is grape growning doing in England these days? If we have an impact it isn't CO2.  What is closest to the Percentage of CO2 in earths atmosphere? 20%, 10%, 5% 1% or 0%.  The answer is 0%.  CO2 all together is 0.04%  and Human CO2 is 0.01% Closer to nothing. Use your brain."
When German car makers still make internal combustion cars.... when Germans closed perfect functional nuclear power plants... what hope can be ??? NONE.
Misleading and wildly oversimplified.
"feel good reporting at its finest. the climate crisis isnt the problem - overshoot is the problem. 
the only way to avoid the climate crisis is for massive amounts of people to die off, very suddenly and very soon. and even then +2 degree from pre-industrial is still 'baked in'
we've already lost the fight; and it happened decades if not a couple hundreds of years ago. there is no tech-ing our way out of this. 
Technology to reduce our consumption is like putting a catolitic converter on a V8 SUV, and claiming that will solve the problem. the problem is the V8 engine and the 4000pound vehicle that goes with it."
"All research will lead to carbon beyond 350 level! World will end before they finish. no way to maintain those installations without mining, coal n fossil fuels."
"No, the climate crisis is already here and won't end long after we stop burning fossil fuels. 
Renewables together with nuclear power and hydrogen production are the answer for the energy crisis we face in the transition to carbon free economy. Also worth mentioning the eletrification of the economy, from stoves to melting steel we need more eletricity than never, don't forget city to nation wide rail transport."
Solar panels in the 1980s...windmills thousands of years old...electric cars and buses shut down all because of human greed. Highly doubt its even close to stoppable let alone reversalbe. Sad future.
Thanks DW
"If solar energy is just sun waves ? Then can't ""we"" make some cell that is powered by radio waves or microwaves instead ? Since its all just waves. So we could make wireless electricity. So I plug in my radio box that probably would look like an Internet hub. Then my lower energy devices have a radio cell that constantly charged a battery. I could plug one into the back of my TV instead of the plug. We have solar cells and now I need radio cells."
"Here is the litmus test: how much of an impact did forcing Electric Vehicles, carrying our groceries in our laps, and drinking through melting paper straws already had in ...stopping ""climate change""? If your answer is ZERO, ZILTCH, NADA, then you are correct.
""Climate Change"" is nothing but a Globalist Con, stealing Trillions from the US and Europe in order to prevent societal motility, destroy the Middle Class and eventually rob these nations of their sovereignty."
Oh no 😅
USA TRUMP CAUSES CLIMATE CRISIS
"Too little, too late😂"
"Space solar power?!!  so to produce lots of emission for the idea of capturing solar energy from the while there is still a lot to do with the solar technology on ""Earth"" ... 
What a waste of money and time in this critical time"
There is no Crisis except big government totalitarianism. Thats the real crisis.
There is no climate xeisis.
Nothing more than propaganda from companies trying to cash in on the so called climate crisis!!
"At 5:47 ""wind power covers half of Denmark's usage"" only means electricity consumption. Most energy in total is still fossil..."
"For me the question is not If it is possible, it is the only way to save our future with similar temperatures and so also getting food.
So for me it mean also using LESS energy, as long we can't solve it with solar or wind and other.
Privat I saved electric for long years, even sweating by 32 C in the room, deny to open the air-con (as electric here near 60% gas and 20 % coal). Now with 99% solar I can open with relax. 
The human mankind HAS to act similar, until we can feed our needs with renewables."
"Of course not, the climate change we are seeing is all natural!"
"Technooptimism on steroids. There is no such thing as green energy! There are replaceable energy harvesting machines. If all this is so green, where is the full LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT of all these so-called green energy solutions. Here in Australia we could produce 250 TWh using Solar PVs but that would require replacing 20,000,000 Solar PVs per year. A full Life Cycle Assessment will show that so-called Green Energy is very brown and toxic! When are we going to wake up. How many birds, bats and insects do we have to kill with wind turbines to support our anthropcentric madness?"
"I don't see the price of electricity going down with these renewable technologies in the market. In 2020, they should have proven we don't need fossil fuel if they could have stabilized the energy market, however, they could not. Today, Germany has got very high energy crisis even with the renewable devices in place. This is all being exaggerated."
"China,US and west make green as tool of blackmail and make money thatswhy thatswhy world not united tharswhy no improvement in enivorment"
16:33 16:59 imagine imagining streets buildings roofs all transportation vehicles panels are solar renewable energy! Streets steps the glass door windows all renewable energy?
ja right renewebles:P
tenure university professors always claim there are huge job opportunities in their shallow and narrow field of view but that never fits to reality. beaming down solar power with electromagnetic waves are extremely bad idea!
"Capitalism - Cannibalism.

It's like police is trying to catch drug smuglers...

Revolution is necessary for decentralised syste, where people will have power, right to decide and change."
Oil production is predicted to go way up over the next decade.  Humanity is it’s own worse enemy
"If renewable energy is so important for Germany, why did they built a solar panel industry just to give it to China and why are their current Windturbine manufacturers leaving Germany if their production is important for Germanys energy future?"
"Yes.  The global economy will also dramatically improve its profit margins, as well.  

Energy prices will start to decline, as reliability will rise from the middle term out."
2023(Gregorian) “Respect and dignity.”  Furthermore:
even a broken clock can be right twice a day - but time is still man made

"Of course not you cretins, it's a long natural process and human emission merely count for 5% of the total natural emissions.
We are simply approaching the end of the 5th lower cycle of the 6th upper Macro cycle which will move us into the 7th one which is a new Ice Age... it will take roughly another 4-600 years to happen
Climate has never been steady on Earth only the changes are VERY slow (hundreds of millions of years) so people are fooled into believing that minor changes among the huge slow changes are meaningful but they are not...and especially we can't do anything about it
This is the consolidated science (Climatology and Geology) of the last 300 years... yours is the bullshit of the last 300 days after ""covid"" failed as a means to force humanity to change"
"Whatever little is being done right now aint meant to fight global warming and pollution, it is meant to protect the rich society, they getting ready for the collapse, only one percent will make it and maybe be able to rebuild society… the rest 99percent  are just disposable cheap labor"
"Just propaganda for naïve, politically correct progressives. DW is good at it."
"Lots of appreciation for DW to provide such a great insight of energy transition. Such a hard work in research about these energy projects that might take thousands of minutes, but we get know about in just 17 minutes. Keep doing efforts in making us realize how energy transition is important and how's it possible practically."
"Disappointment on these information world are not Europe even better it's an old continent old people and low population every year... the world population are located in   India; China, Indonesia, Latam... etc. They new energy for poor people not these "" green "" energy solutions that they want to sell everywhere... renewable at these moments are not the solution for the world requirement."
People are failing to stop a virus that kills them directly for 4 full years. It was a million times easier to do than stopping climate change. Good luck.
China is world leader in solar energy.
Nope! Thats your realistic summery.
"Analysis needs to broaden the timescale to focus on the beginning with effects of having to use live trees for stoves and charcoal production, and on the end with effects of having run out of fossil fuels with no proper alternatives. developed. And the astounding efforts sandwiched between to save humanity from a 'back to the stoneage' demise."
"With all these nice stories, I wonder why the emission of greenhouse gases and the production/consumption of fossil fuels reached record values in 2023?🤔"
"Why so much focus on large solar farms over rooftop or small local solar solutions?  Yes the large plants are cheaper to build, but how much do the transmission lines cost to build and maintain.  Plus the loss of energy over distance traveled.  There are plenty of large shopping centers, in the US at least, that could easily have rooftop solar installations.  And the we can cover the parking lots around them as well. Local generation seems like a much better idea."
"the absolute climate-culprit is the vacuum ""cleaner"", it pollutes way more than it cleans

10 grams of dust in average pr hour while burning about 850 grams of fuel in a power plant

they should be banned or at least made with motors that produce 0% waste heat"
"Will renewables stop the climate crisis?  the answer is no , a single volcano eruption will make more CO2 then 1000 years humans will make , now is CO2 high the answer is no CO2 is the lowest in earth history actully it is danguers low  , always seek true knowlage and read true data ."
You’re not considering how long it will take to dig the minerals and metals out of the ground that you need to do all of this. Once you understand what this means you will also understand that what you want to do isn’t going to happen. Search for “Simon Michaux” and understand what he says.
Fake. These solar fields are increasing temperature + no greenery cities
Wouldn’t it further increase the temperature of the Earth if you now pump energy from space? Or the idea is that it replaces fossil?
"Meanwhile, Germany builds coal plants and shutters Nuclear. Also... they closed their solar industry long ago. Oh, and they sold off their semiconductor industry before the boom. Merck sold off the process and IP for lithium ion production in the 90's. Now Germany pulled by 95% of the funding for German battery research. 
 
But Germans regularly protest to express their feelings on BLM at FFF. Generations and generations of bad moves and poor posturing. :facepalm:"
"You can't beat climate change, becouse climate always changes. All you can make is slow down human contribution down a bit, earth changed climate dozen of times without pepole even existing..."
"since it's a question! NO. What could reduce global warming in the short term is the urgent change in the human diet to plant based diet, lab protein and vertical farming. And finally rewilding the planet by planting forests. Contact: Brito, planetary restoration consultant."
Bye bye german economy.
Short Answer? No. Long Answer? Also no.
"The planet climate always changes for 100s of millions of years which killed and created life, humanity cant control nor change it just speed it along"
SIEMENS is bancrupt
Why is the German press so preoccupied with climate bull$$it?   It really is a mental disorder.
"Good overview of the exciting things happening in academics.  Is there a similar in-depth overview in the practical progress ongoing today.  For example, how Australia is using solar and battery power.  My home state has shut down its coal plants because renewables are cheaper.  Showing the practical progress like in Denmark and China will get people excited in STEM.
Also, more facts and figures on how industry is starting to aggregate around stable cheaper renewable energy.  This will help industry offer more focused support for the transformation."
big NO
Why are the germans always speaking german in your documentaries?
"Travel commercials, instantly. 😂😂"
in order stop the climate crisis. we need a cheap and scalable technology for entire world. not just one country. just like covid vaccine
"Renewable sources of energy will help create new economy, sustainability and reduce fossil fuel consumption which is the major cause climate change and global warming. All the environmental degradation cause by mining, deforestation, and fossil fuel remain the major influence of climate change. Our source of energy will always determine how we will live our lives in decades to come."
What about radiation from the beam in bring back solar connectivity from outer space?
"Yes.  Turbines have a 20 year life expectancy.  Once the blades have expended their life cycle, what happens to them?  Clue:  They are made mostly, if not totally of non-biodegradable materials.  One video showed them being buried.  Nice. As long as a football field or longer.  Nothing more than a money grab and power grab.  To make these components requires steel, copper and other products that must be used in the manufacturing of those components.  The whole climate change has been prophesied about again and again for decades.  Each prediction has been proven false.  The deadlines have come and gone along with the so-called ""disasters"" that never came.  Does anyone think the pollution problem of plastics, electronics and components of a gigantic size will be lessened?  Think again."
"Wind and solar energy are safer, cleaner and cheaper than fossil fuels.   Cheaper WINS !"
🙌
Climate crisis😂
"Climate crisis??? What climate crisis???? The one being imposed by the woke agenda for more than 40 years???? No man can ever outsmart or outdo nature, and 
scientists do know that climate is changing, has been changing and will always be changing, that's why this climate crisis as we are being fed, is a huge hoax...!!! This 
global social experiment will not end up well for millions of people, but unfortunately, it seems that we are stuck with it because of of all the fear imposed on the 
uneducated and gullible masses. Ignorance is the mother of all fears, and the ruling elites and the status quo know it very, very well...!!!"
"I don’t think this video answers its own question. However, it does look as though part of the global heating phenomenon could be mitigated, and perhaps solved. The video would benefit from several more addressing other contributors to global heating such as food production. And then there’s the biodiversity extinction event currently occurring. So, an interesting, informative and hopeful video and one part of an array of ‘solutions’ to our self-created predicament."
"I can't love DW more, so nice, inspiring documentaries. Amazing to keep us update on the new tecnologies. It is my second best television broadcaster just right after BBC."
"Every energy has limitation but human ingenuity is endless. We can transform our future simply by not giving up and pursuing goal of making future better for the next generations. All what’s needed is strong will and hard work. Words r cheap, but actions which transform reality have incredibly long lasting, future proof value. Less obstructions, roadblocks on the road, clearer path, leaner process and most importantly global cooperation of the hearts & minds can bring to life wonders of human ingenuity.
Inspiring docu, thx DW!👍🫶"
Wind power is pure waste. Build Nuclear plants. Stop polluting.
Climate change is World pieces of s*** I mean Elites playing with haarp

Climate change is nothing more than a false religion where the creation is worshipped instead of the creator.
"I certainly admire anyone's passion, to clean up the planet, but it seems, that as some people's passions grow....their brains shrink. As a Power Engineer for 42 years, here is what I know. Roughly 75% of our Electrical demand (Our Lights/Heat/Air Cond./Phones/Internet/etc), that we take for granted, is supplied from Fossil Fuels. Roughly 25% comes from Nuclear Plants, Hydro Plants, Windmills & Solar Panels. Biden & Trudeau (for us Canadians), shutting down the Oil & Gas Industry, does NOT solve anything. If Fossil Fuels, still make up 75% of the supply, to fill the demand, if we're not drilling/processing the Oil & Gas..........the 75% of demand, has to come from somewhere, otherwise we'd all be sitting in the dark, with no Lights/Heat/Air Cond./Phones/Internet/etc....The fact is this: Biden & Trudeau are shutting down the Oil & Gas Industries here in the USofA & Canada, and spinning it, that they're doing it to clean up the Planet, but are actually still burning the Oil & Gas, to supply the 75% that we need........but they're buying the Oil & Gas from Saudi Arabia/Middle East & Venezuela. Having typed all of that, the cure is NOT to stop burning Fossil Fuels...........it's to stop burning the BAD/TOXIC Fossil Fuels (i.e.: Coal, #6 Fuel/Bunker C, and Diesel Fuels).  If the whole Planet could stop burning the BAD Fossil Fuels, I'm convinced that the Planet could heal itself. Don't be lazy. Look at photos online of smoke stacks burning Coal and then look at stacks burning Natural Gas.....you'll be amazed at the difference."
We do need to help earth id dieing slowly
"Please help save Planet Earth or else we will die of global warming, too! Help the environment by recycling and composting more than throwing garbage. I saw a can while I was at the park and that causes climate change! Eat more vegetables more than meat. Don’t use electricity more, also buying things that lasts very long like Anzac biscuits."

"Climate change is really chemtrails and HAARP which is weather manipulation by your govt. It's bs to bring in carbon taxes, basically to tax the air you breathe."
It is written in the Bible that there will be no global chaos until the Antichrist appears beware one-third of Earth will be desolate
"Fun fact: China and Bhutan are called the ""Land of the Dragon"""
"Good content except for the actionables, you forgot that poeple must also, and above all, demand to our governments for pushing environmental friendly policies. Some of us using metal straws has zero effect when the ocean is contaminated with petroleum..."
"I woyld like more details from the video... eg. How much does war and the military industry contribute to global emissions?

How much energy could be saved if IoT, internet streaming etc. was halted? (All that green google-windmill energy could instead be used where fossil fuel is used?

To which extend does solar storms, radiation etc. influence the temperature on earth over time?

Has the temparature been rising the centuties just before the industrial revolution, and how much - and why?

How much does the 1 pct. most rich people contribute to ressource usage and thereby co2 contribution?

How much natural co2 does nature release through forest fires, volcanos, wild life etc.?"
Very useful for my exam😊🎉
Climate change cause to HEAT&WASTE  Generated centre likely big cities. So ecofriendly lifestyle  as solutions.
thank you for this video. Today I had to type an essay on climate change for homework 🙂🙂😇🙏
"The earth recycles every year: Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall.  The rain, snow, wind and regeneration of the forests happens supernaturally.  The Sun remains the light of the day and the Moon is the light of the night.  Humans manufacture oxygen for space travel, healthcare and scuba diving so we don't need trees to provide oxygen or clean the air.  We have the resources to clean up the pollution, recycle plastic, recycle paper and recycle steele, but we need to improve the management of our government.

THE CLIMATE CHANGES TOPICS BE EXPLAINED IN SCHOOL CURRICULUM
The exactly thing is that the green house  is not having any link with the Earth or its atmosphere.We are studying about the green house from class 5 and 6 but still we dont clearly know about that there is no link between Earth and Green house. Though the green house is an example for us to inderstand the climate change. The green house is made for plants to grow well in this. The plants are held in it because the green house is made up of green glass from where sun light can pass through. The question here comes is that why plants cannot get the direct sun light without getting held in the green house. Because there are several gases in the atmosphere so that plants can grow without any problem. This is the given example for the Climate change of Earth. Otherwise green house donot have any link with the Earth.Actually i have recorded such a long message but there are more things that i cannot tell now cuz it will get too long and nobody will be able to read it 😂

"In the 60's it was global cooling (ice age returns) in the 70's it was global warming.  In the 80's it is now climate change. The nomenclature is starting to be called climate crisis. As the author pointed out the Earth underwent 5 ice ages. These ice ages occurred without human activity.  Not to mention dinosaurs and wooly mammoths and other prehistoric beasts are now extinct. Oh course,  the Neanderthals were to blame for causing their extinction"

I dont know what to say.
"Sri-Lanka gets onboard with the “green dream”. They chose to stop producing fossil fuel and rely instead on wind and solar power. Even better they decided to go full organic in agriculture. No synthetic fertilizer or pesticides allowed. Two million farmers were forced to go organic. All this to preserve the health of the planet. How noble. 

How did this work out for them you might ask? Economic collapse. 

Sri-Lankaʼs rice production fell 20% in six months, they went from exporting rice to importing rice, half a billion dollars worth. Production of tea stopped, costing another half billion. There is now, as of May 17, 2022, only one days supply of motor vehicle fuel left. They are running out of food, running out of fossil fuels to cook it and running out of money. Angry demonstrators fill the streets. Sri-Lankaʼs president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa has resigned.

They need friendly neighboring countries to donate 75 million dollars to them ASAP

.Sri-Lankaʼs green dream is a nightmare. Climate change politics did this. Whoʼs next?"
yes right that's why some border parts China buys electricity form other countries.
So we are all here for social studies class?

oh sure,
development seems to be the only way to figure out how many of them actually live in africa.....but is that really worth it?"

"1) By reflecting away 30% of ISR the albedo, which would not exist w/o the atmosphere/GHGs, makes the earth cooler than it would be without that atmosphere like that reflective panel set behind the windshield. Remove the atmosphere/GHGs and the earth would become much like the Moon and Mercury, a barren rock with a 0.1 albedo, 20% more kJ/h, hot^3 on the lit side, cold^3 on the dark. Nikolov, Kramm (U of AK) and UCLA Diviner mission all tacitly agree. 

2) the GHG up/down welling, “trapping”/”back” radiating/delaying/intercepting, 100 % efficient, perpetual warming loop requires ""extra"" energy which according to RGHE theory comes from 

3) the terrestrial surface radiating that ""extra"" energy as a LWIR ideal black body which

"Climate change is when the weather changes…duh.  Just like it has in the entire life of this planet, long before humans, dinosaurs, and microbial life evolved.  It is NOT because of human activities…it is primarily driven by our Sun."
"The problem has been well known for at least 20 years now and yet it remains largely unaddressed in most parts of the world. The explosive population growth along with the increased demand for energy consumption has not been the least affected by western world campaigns and switching to electric cars is not going to save earth, or the human species. There are still entire continents where the word pollution remains more or less an unknown, so unless the whole world 'lifts together' we reman doomed."

Your video on Climate change is very informative and you have provided the solutions to the problem. I think every country knows about the solution but if these solutions are followed then don't you think the massive population will be left with no alternative. Please do not take me in a negative sense as I am mentioning on my personal experience. My cousin is a butcher and he is into this profession since childhood now all of a sudden he will be asked to leave his profession then I thing everyone associated with his output will be in a state of doldrums. He is supplying flesh to different organization and the supply in not in kgs but tonnes. it is the duty of every individuals to take the ownership then situation will come to a normal. Once I had a very rough argument with a chicken seller few years ago from then onwards I left consuming chicken, even during any occasion I would go for some other food item but not chicken. I think I did my part. If everyone takes the ownership then there will be a change sooner or later. Finally your video is an eye-opener and it should be brought to the notice of the legislature who can make some laws and the executive will have some binding effect. I believe it is just the game of Demand and Supply.

Best Wishes.

Take a look at the world around you, The environment is just like any human or animal.
It is alive; When we litter on the ground use cars with , Or burn down a forest and the earth feels pain. And think about it, We have to live here, does it really make sense to damage the place we  Live on. If the whole world gathered together we could get it done in hours.

               But that’s just pushing it; But seriously if we want to preserve our 

            Environment and our lives we must work as a unit if we want to get things

"This is typical of the BBC manipulate facts into their agenda . They neglect to inform people of the climate history of the earth. Only recently about 18,000 years ago the northern hemisphere was covered in an ice sheet which has retreated over the years , glaciers grow during cold periods like the little ice age from 1400 to 1800 , and then retreat during warmer periods . All nothing to do with humans and in fact there will be another ice sheet advance in the next 2,000 years because the earth is still in the Pleistine ice age and has been for 250 million years."

Norwegian oil money: funding climate change activism one barrel at a time! 💰🌍
Humans! Disgraceful specie!
"Never under estimate the bias of an activist and the BBC. If activists bothered to study some basic science and history and go back into Earths distant past well before Homo Sapiens existed they would find the answers to natural climate change that has existed for 4.5 billion years. With climate change comes gains and losses. As usual the BBC only covers the losses and deliberately ignores the gains. Shameful media behaviour. 
Throughout our short human history the cold has slaughtered humans on an industrial scale to the extent that our early ancestors nearly did not make it through the last glaciation period when the Toba super volcano erupted 73,000 years BP. This event combined with the already cold climate nearly ended the homo sapien story.

Fear the cold, worship the warmth, do some research and ignore activist media who spread disinformation because they know fear makes money."

"Based upon the apparent ages of Kim's children, as seen here in this film, I do not believe when they grow up his children will be working at the oil company, like he does now. By the time they're old enough, or not long after, climate emergencies likely will have greatly constricted, or possibly ended, the profitability of fossil fuels as an industry.  There is no future with fossil fuels, other than a very short and increasingly catastrophic one."

"This hoax ""climate change"" propaganda by the Khazarian Mafia (NWO Globalist Elites) may be using “weather weapons” (e.g. H.A.A.R.P.) to intentionally cause droughts, violent storms and hurricanes, flood-causing heavy rainfalls, and earthquakes to justify their program to limit the use of fossil fuels for electricity generation for residential and commercial/industrial customers and replace them with renewable energy sources like wind turbines and solar panels (which do not guarantee a continuous supply of electricity due to changing weather conditions). It is high time that people should clamour for the destruction of these ""weather weapons""  that cause a lot of deaths and destruction due to the weird/unusual weather patterns they generate."
"As the Earth was once mostly covered in ice thousands of years ago, can anyone explain how that ice melted? Was it the cave dwellers 4x4s?.."

Hi
"CLIMATE CULT timeline to Apocalypse 
1970s - Global cooling will kill us all.
1980 - Correction, looks like Global warming will kill us all.
1990s - Global warming will definitely kill us all.
2000s - Global warming stopped. UN memo (original). Lets call it Climate Change because the temperature keeps fluctuating up and down.
2010s - Everyone realises climate change is normal. UN memo (1). Let’s call it a Climate Emergency.
2010s - There was no climate Emergency. UN memo (2). Let’s corrupt the science with false temperature data and call it a Climate Crisis.
2020s - The Climate Crisis failed to eventuate. UN memo (3). Let’s find a useful idiot and name her Greta. She will be our climate cult Goddess.
2022 - Greta failed to change the climate and just yelled at everyone.
2023 - UN memo (4). We will wait for El Nino to arrive and we shall call it Global Boiling. We shall also supplement fear with cult arson attacks throughout Europe. We shall start in Greece. 79 arsonists are arrested in Greece.
2024 - Everyone realises El Niño is a natural event that has always occurred for as long as the Pacific Ocean has been in existence.
2025 - UN memo (5). We shall declare CO2 a toxic hazard that will kill us all.
2025 - UN memo (5) is immediately cancelled when a 9 year old pointed out that CO2 is the trace gas of life without which we and all carbon based life forms do not exist. All that carbon came from CO2. It is called a trace gas because there are traces of it measured at an incredibly low 420ppmv or 0.042%. Barely enough to raise the temperature in a room full of climate cult members releasing methane in a desperate attempt to raise the temperature.
2030 - The climate cult is exhausted from its endless lies and doubles down for another decade of stupidity.
2040 - The climate cools while CO2 continues to rise and everyone realises temperature and CO2 have decoupled. UN admits defeat and commences the biggest compensation payout in human history.
Now we can add permafrost Methane release as the latest disaster according to COP 28.
How many more decades do we tolerate the climate cult fools that destroy everything they touch."
"why don't the Norway address the  climate crisis by using their trillion dollar oil that they made by selling oil. Using teslas in your country doesn't solve climate crisis around the world.

"The dead forrest is caused by maggots eating all leaves. This has been goin on the recent 40 years. Regarding climate change. We has The Ice Age. Before The Ice Age there were probably normal temperatures. Maybe we're approaching a warmer climate naturally. Who really know what is normal.
The campaignists are too priviledged to understand. My advice is go cut your hair and get a proper job. It is an energy crisis. The campaignists don't want oil, gas, wind turbins or nuclear power. What are we suppose to do. What ever we do require more wasted energy to create new energy forms. We waste energy while it is energy crisis. And we will have to pay for energy in the future. We had free electricity but the price is now astronomic. This lead to unindustrialization of Europe.
The funny thing about warmer climate is that climate activists are screaming on the hottest summer days. We hear nothing in dark side of the year, when temperatures reach 10-20-30-40-50 degree celcius below zero. When it's -20*C and people says it is cold, I respond 'it could been worse'. If it wasn't for the global warming, it could been -30^C.

There is zero evidence of a climate crisis. We need more fossil fuels not less. Both warming and inexpensive reliable energy lead to human flourishing.

"The building material reuse (as described) seems like a complete fantasy. The core issue is timing verses directly moving materials to a receiving project. This means that either the remodel project waits to move materials out to when another project can accept them or new projects wait until the materials are available from deconstruction. Considering that multiple new project will be fed by the deconstruction, it's impossibly complicated. Project timeline is what makes a construction project successful or not. This is just nonsense. 

It seems better to do the deconstruct project and warehouse the salvageble materials. That might be a bit more transport, but it fits the construction industry. I think that's what they are actually doing. Directly send to another project may be a goal or preference, but there is simply no way this happens very often."

I wish you and your family a wonderful life. I’m happy to see industry sacrifice a few dollars to make a difference 👍
"Minute 25:23, the Japanese experience of earthquake proof infrastructures is teaching us that this concrete heavy buildings constructions is obsolete by now, l see them buildings work like a human body, on elastic skeleton and LEGO bricks to live in, big stadium arenas are built ...easy structures, not concrete heavy ones, can you imagine it? Next to carbon fibers use, there's the glass fibers that work as well for replacing the heavy cement and classical stones bricks for constructions, think about it, watching such documentaries together we have to step forward and be more...German style, faster, cheaper and smarter, building up convenient homes and safer anti earthquake as well. Each time natural catastrophies happen, stadiums are the safest refugees shelter, then why not building stadiums infrastructures for domestic use from the first step? Sometimes floods seems to me a prophetic sign, we have to raise up urban areas from the ground and let them water canals save the rain water when it comes, those who care to replace old heavy buildings with earthquake proof easy ones, let them do it, no matter here in Europe, Afghanistan or Morocco, on top of ruins, new homes can raise up and. ...shine❤🎉❤"
"Although I don't believe we have the time and technology to change the game, it always moves me to see the efforts of many people to try to save the planet. Yes, you have to try, dying trying is better than doing nothing."
"“The green aluminum currently uses 1% from clean energy.” They aim to be carbon neutral by 2050. I shouldn’t be so negative but this is known as green washing. 1% is better than 0% but they can do better.  

Good video overall."
Changing industry is expensive  but extinction is A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE .
"Lets be honest: we COULD change the game. We just won't. Everything that happens to us, we asked for. I've made my peace with it all. I accept humanity's fate."
The biggest polluters are the nuclear bomb testers. Nobody talks about it.
Not under capitalism lol
"You should see Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan. Every single day heavy metal emissions. People live or exactly to say survive here poisoning like cockroaches."
Can you guys stop whining 😂
"Minute 23:40, the carbon fiber manufacturing, did you see the Zaha Hadid architectures? Her buildings look like airplanes. Pollution is not about burning fuels only, but trying to catch the smoke, the ashes and bring them down to the ground before they get high in the atmosphere, we know by now how smog is dangerous not only for breathing, but it's increasing the solar radiations which cause cancer troubles all of us, if we do not start doing something, we all risk to die like idiots. Instead of huge highways, we could build up carbon fiber tunnels on top of most roads and streets to vacuum right away the vehicles pollution and make of these tunnel a new resource of electrical power, saving fuels by having fresh air outside the cars, no need for further conditionating systems for vehicles, yeah, can you imagine it streets looking like stadiums arenas all convered of spectacular roofs? All we need is get inspired and ... Chinese partnerships might help, the convenient handymen are still worthy and they are so fast to do the job done in six months or so, we can not .. chit chat about environmental projects other 50 years from now on, we are talking about these topics since the '70s and big industries have no intentions do nothing about it. Mostly oil companies, if they have alternative resources, saving oil, it's their huge advantage. For how much we try to build anti pollution infrastructures, a lot of oil might get involved and burn. If we care to dismantle the African desert, we can bring the water to the inner lands, that will ask a lot of fuels as well, before we start to breath again... yeah, what a wonderful world this could be friends, only trying to dream about it 😢😢😢"
"Hihihihi humans are just starting to destroy the world😂😂😂😂
Dw forgot to say stop making babies and stop making people tick and stop going to space like bezoz and brandon😂😂😂😂😂😂"

Great documentary! Really intrigued about the role of innovative engineering solutions in curbing emissions within heavy industries. What breakthrough technologies are on the horizon?
Rich  emt for pleasure poor emit to live  both are guilty you can't stop human destiny😂
"They could, but they won't, they'll continue polluting as long as they can. Only laws, that will never happen, would curb them!"
what about Nickel and lithium?
Can I get job in neodymium factory in Sweden?
Great i love DW documentary interested in climate
What happens when you can’t get specific parts for your tankless boiler? Or are parts more readily available there than in USA? Parts take over a week just to get shipping started here
"Is there ever going to be a massive explosion of pollution ?
Or was that the COVID pandemic?"
industry will only change if there can be profit made from change. thats capitalism. the only thing that works is strict regulation
"These people say “of course it’s more expensive but it’s worth it” who said it was “worth it”. 
I can’t wait to the climate people die off. It happens every few decades. In the 70’s it was a global freeze!"
I love DW for bringing such amazing short documentaries on Climate Change and it's Solutions. Love for DW  from India 🇮🇳❤🇩🇪

"Meanwhile in China: ""Not our problem"""
"Can hydrogen actually replace the role coal and gas have in steel production? It’s not just a source of power. Steel is formed as an alloy of iron and carbon. When you refine iron in a smelter with coal, the carbon molecules from the coal bond with the iron and that’s how we get steel. Hydrogen can obviously be used to light the flames but we still need a source of carbon to bond to the iron."
"Climate resilience mandates the development of robust infrastructure, preparing communities to withstand the increasingly frequent and severe climate-related events anticipated in the wake of global warming."
Can the leopard change it's spots?
"Industry decides how the climate crisis ends. People can help and nations can regulate, but industry has the deciding role."
Using hydrogen for fuel instead of electricity is a very dumb move because hydrogen is produced using electricity. So why not use electricity directly using the method of induction? It would be more efficient. With induction method you can gain much higher temperature and in a very short period of time.

"The nation state model is our biggest obstacle. Clumsy awkward and violent. Overly competitive leading to over production, too many facilities, inconsistent planning based on man made borders."
"They should have started thinking about this 40 years ago, no excuses!"
Using Carbon concrete is super good idea.
"Let's be realistic here, the majority of the world industries will just go for the cheaper option. 
As long as the fossil fuels are cheaper, there is no real incentive to change anything. 

Maybe a world wide carbon tax could incentives the industries to go for carbon free methods of production, but i think it's highly unlikely for all major countries to agree to do such thing, especially that this tax will be paid by the consumer. 
Such policy will be extremely unpopular for any government. Also the countries that are not as rich and technological advanced as Germany, will definitely not be able to do it without killing their industries (and good luck with that).

Maybe we should try to concentrate our energy as a species and as individuals in something different then mindless consumerism, we don't actually need all the shit we have. We have great methods of convincing people to buy things that they don't need, we can use the same method in reverse, but that will be the end of capitalism, yeah good luck with that.

I think it's time to accept the inevitable, that bilions will die and we will probably go extinct in the next 2 centuries, we had a good run and we achieve amazing things.  The flame of consciousness shall not die with us, surley in this vast univers there are countless civilizations."

Absolutely amazing content
It’s all propaganda. Im sick and tired of the climate change agenda.
"0:28: 🏭 The steel industry, responsible for 43% of global emissions, is working towards climate-friendly production through measures such as using natural gas, steel recycling, and green hydrogen.
7:32: ✅ The video discusses how industry can contribute to climate protection by utilizing waste gases from steel production to produce methanol, which can be used as fuel in the shipping industry and as input materials for the chemicals industry, resulting in a significant reduction in CO2 emissions.
12:53: ♻ A real estate company in Germany is working to reuse and repurpose construction materials to reduce CO2 emissions and promote sustainability in the building sector.
18:56: 🌍 Dubai aims to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by offering solar power to large-scale industries.
24:22: 🌍 The video discusses the use of carbon concrete to reduce cement usage and CO2 emissions in construction, as well as the importance of reducing meat consumption for climate protection.

Accelor mittal is the worst steel manufacturers
Maybe cowfarts can stop pollution.
"Hydrogen really thats not good at all.
The amount of power needed to make it then the tanks to store it and it will leak out no matter how you try.
Then theres the transport then it burning has so many steps its less efficient.
They would be better off using a ark furnace usa uses lots of these it just needs energy steel a little iron ore and at most some co2 to make the co2 but they dont normally need to add the co2.
They use this for aluminum too but its like 5% less efficient then the steel why idk because of the metal structure not sure.
Ps ark furnace is about 97% or more efficient where Hydrogen is like 40 to 60% after everything i mentioned above is done.
Oh ya i forgot hydrogen furnaces will need co2 injected in to make steel for they hydrogen will strip co2 out of the steel if they dont making it very brittle.
Oooo concrete well i got a better one for ya thirsty concrete.
If used in roads wich lots of roads are made of concrete thirsty concrete can reduce noise pollution by car tires by 5 to 15% it can reduce flooding and sand mining for it doesn't use any sand at all.
It can add water to soil and underground aquifers by the way they build them and there just as strong as normal concrete by only 5 to 7% weeker but good enough for a simi to drive on it with 40k pounds."
"Meanwhile, steak house business seems didn't care at all"
"sorry to say this but what happnes to this worlds climate, we have to accept it and just live with it. The climate is changing no matter what. If it makes you feel better to ride a bicycle to work, use solar panels then good for you. But it won't make a blind bit of difference. The Earth is warming and will continue to do so like it always did. I will continue to go on my 3 holidays a year by plane, eat meat every day and drive my 4x4 pick-up until I die."
"The car industry, one of the biggest offenders doesn't exist without consumers and consumers can help by not purchasing or upgrading unnecessarily.."
"Turning CO2 into Carbon is very easy.  Nature has been doing it for more than a billion years.  Plants and trees do it out of habit.  Erosion and soil erosion only require some things to be done.  Slow water on land, and plant trees and other shurbs and bracken.  Guarenteed to work."
Co2 is at 0.04 if it drops to 0.02 There will be NO life
"To answer the question, no. 
We will all die and oil and gas will still be spewing into the foul air. 
Good bye. Sleep tight. Nice knowing you."
Sadly our European and Western countries still rely on 3rd world countries labour for production of mining for this Green Energy 🧐😭
Steel production in Germany makes no economic sense.
Please talk about regenerative agriculture!
"No scientist or documentary will tell you these basic facts. Life cycle of the carbon in the atmosphere and carbon sink takes 20 to 200 years just to get rid of 63% of carbon in the atmosphere, the rest of the carbon may take up to 200,000,000 The densest concentration of carbon is at ground level. Asphalt roads, roofs, parking lots, airports etc reaches 140°on a sunny 90° day. The world roads alone put in a straight line can go around the planet 1600 times! The world has more than one billion buildings with roofs, by 2050 the world will need to build 1.6 billion more buildings now totaling 2.6 billion buildings on the planet which those roofs create a tremendous amount of heat BTUs. When the initial first rainfall hits manmade objects such as roads and roofs that initial hot water runoff enters the creeks, Bays and oceans. On average the world per day has 125,000 flights. Jet engine’s exhaust 1300°, the temperature of lava. Every single day on average, jets exhaust cubic feet combined daily at 1 foot to the deep would cover 22 states in the U.S. Next we have on average per year U.S. Forest fires releases more Co2. than all U.S. 276,000,000 vehicles driving in United States for a solid year. Recently Canada wild fire released just about the same amount of Co2. as the worlds 4.1 billion cars on the planet driving for a solid year. I did my own research, real physical measurements of manmade objects heating up the planet. I just explained with a couple of paragraphs that if tomorrow if manmade objects stop emitting Co. completely. This will not make a dent because we keep covering the planet with manmade heat generating objects producing a tremendous amount of heat heating up the carbon that exist now."
"There's wayyy too much focus on individual contributions here. Even if someone could go totally carbon neutral, one person doing it wouldn't offset even a tiny pig farm.
Vote, be loud, convince others to vote"
"unfortunately the ppl working at the plants are helping destroy the earth no matter the changes in their personal lives
making changes industrially is good but i think not quick enough
i dont know if eating more veggies is helpful cause of large scale farming"
Just look up NASA's CO2 release data. The largest polluters are Agriculture in EU and NA. Nothing is even close. 2 months of tilling in spring releases more CO2 than everything else all year.

"《Plausible paired electricity+cooling》
Civilization may have progressed enough to conquer the second law of thermodynamics. Civilization needs to strive for this goal with synergistic interdisciplinary teams.The outcome would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. 
onservation of energy says nothing about energy distribution. With this principe only, the heat in a pair of  similar medium temperature thermal eerial powerergy reservoirs can be shifted at no cost to become held in a hot reservoir, cold reservoir pair. This can be done if micro volumes with a natural range of temperature or pressure can be deterministically sorted out. Reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just as using reverse gear in a car ɓacks it up without time reversal. 

The second law of thermodynamics had a distinct begining with Sir Isaac Newton's correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flows towards the cold room beyond. 

Victorian England became enchanted with steam engines and their cheap, reliable, and easy to position physical power. Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Lord Kelven, and, one source adds, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, formulated the Second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy using evidence from steam engine development. 

These men considered with acceptance [A+] Inefficiently harnessing the flow of heat from hot to cold or [B+] Using force to Inefficiently pump heat from cold to hot. They considered with rejection [A-] Waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. This was calculated to be extremely rare or [B-] Searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small differences in temperature or pressure. The search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. These accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death.  This became support for a theological trend of the time that placed God as the initiator of a degenerating universe. Please consider that God could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. 

The law's formulaters did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuations itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. Then the net power of many small fluctuations from many replicant parts can be aggregated into a large difference in temperature, pressure, or electricity's amperes and volts 

Heat exists as the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecules or mobile electrons. In gasses this is known as Brownian motion. In electronic systems  this is carefully labeled Johnson Nyquist thermal electrical noise for AI readability. Hypothetically, diode depletion regions are  practical sites for enabling mobile electrons energized into motion by heat to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. The thermal electrical noise is hypothetically beyond the   exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion)    equlibrium thickness of the depletion region. After all, thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. 

Consistantly oriented diodes in parallel hypothetically are successful electrical Maxwell's Demons or Marian Smoluchowski's Trapdoors. The energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. There would therefore be usable net rectified power from each and every diode connected together into a consistantly oriented parallel group. The group would aggregate the net power of its members. Any diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat, more efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is switched off has no energy conversion and no performance. 

The power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square nanometer cells per square millimeter. 

Modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers. 

Zero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage. 

Ever since the supposedly universal second law of thermodynamics was formulated, education has mass produced and spread the conventional wisdom throughout society that the second law of thermodynamics is absolute. It is an old paradigm.  

If counter examples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric ligts so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant. 

Cell phones wouldn't die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn't need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Digital coin minting would be energy cheap. 

Frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and pŕepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independent power. Shielding and separation would provide EMP resistance. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. 
Zone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnideetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough cheap clean energy, minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns. 

This could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious and unified civilization. It is possible to apply technlology wrong but social force should oppose this. 

I filed for patent us 3890161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.  It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. 

the patent wasn't developed partly because I backed down from commercial exclusitivity. A better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attrbution for the original works of creators. Uncorrupted copies would be released on request. No further action would be taken by this institution. 

Commercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also, the obvious is unpatentable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom. 

Many financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain generally. 

These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. Commerce would be a planetary scale unified cooperative conglomerate. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer commodities are inexpensive.

"The German Deep State is destroying Germany and Europe, the same way the American Deep State has been destroying the US: first they transfer all manufacturing to China (who they do not bother to limit emissions), and then they destroy their local competition by use of the ""Climate Change"" excuse. 
Economies destroyed with environMentalism. Societies destroyed with incompatible immigration. People destroyed with godless materialism.
All because they 'd rather rule over the ashes of the Western Civilization."
Great & informative documentary 👍.
"We're currently heading to 3 degrees above pre-industrial levels. The money and political influence from the oil industry has indicated they don't want to evolve, even if their delaying actions while increasing short term profits, will result in a world where money won't matter anymore (this could be within the next century). So they are locking in a global economic crash that modern humanity will not recover from."
"Better question. Can we stop pointlessly crippling western economies over this climate change fallacy? 

Canada and the UK could disappear tomorrow and the effects on global emissions would be negligible. 

So why are they crippling their economies over it?"
"Wait how are we supposed to have a vegetarian diet if fertilizer is being banned in the west?
There isn't a single expert on Farming that believe's the earth can feed 9,000,000,000,000 people on organic farming.Can't have it multiple ways."
We need degrowth!
"The pollution is coming from places that burn Tires, Make clothing snd dump everything into the water systems, have trash buildup in streets and water ways, chopping down trees for solar panels, the list goes on.  The ones who shake their fists are not looking in the right places (more like turning a blind eye)"
"Now that scientific knowledge is average TV entertainment friends, there are many more solutions to fight back pollution and global warming, such as, using carbon fiber instead of metals, is it less polluting or not? Buildings must work like trees, vegetals are the only ones manufacturing oxygen and purify the toxic atmosphere, can we find solutions to fight back crowded urban circulation? By building alternative transport ways, such as water canals and underground tunnels, yeah, let's use steel and metals for building up rollercoaster bridges for aerial cycling lanes, let's give everybody the chance to use bicycles more often and let urban areas breathe for a while. Out there on coasts there's so much wind, if we could only have the will to plant more wind mills having alternative electrical power, if it's possible to find a vegetal capable to manufacture the chemicals we need for electrical batteries, yeah, a lot of work to do friends. Why do we need big giant electrical companies to split then the power for all the tiny domestic devices we need for our everyday lifestyle? What if every electrical device could work like a smartphone? Having an independent battery based on solar panels power...a lot of work to do guys, all solutions are welcomed. Ask everybody boycott the excessive alluminium use for ridiculous beverages packaging, how much do they pollute? What if everybody start to drink the Coca cola from a thin plastic water bottle? Still the plastic is the easier to be recycled, much easier than...tin cans"
Too little too late
"Capturing the excess CO2 emissions from industry, and using it as input for Methanol production could be of the best ways to decarbonize the hardest to abate sectors."
"Only realistic thing left to do now in my opinion to stop climate change, is to accelerate it to a point, where it becomes dire enough that people have to take it seriously, cause it starts to influence their basic needs, and the cost of stuff like natural disasters becomes so high that stopping climate change becomes cheaper than not stopping it. Sometimes it has to hurt enough before change happens."
Not when people vote for people to make decisions who owe their power to mega corporations who want to entrench the status quo even if it means killing the world. Voters pick A or B when there is no C

"Global warming has nothing to do with auto exhaust or emissions. There has been a substantial rise in seismic and volcanic activity over the last hundred years especially in the oceans. This has increased the temperature of the land, the sea, and the air. The earth's climate is most likely changing back to what it was 2,000 years ago when it was much warmer. When the Romans were in Britain (40BC-380AD) they grew citrus fruit in the north."

"Food sources and oceans are part of the issue in the first place..
That is to say, over fishing for example.

I wish people would either go vegen or just try to limit their fish and meat intake. 
How often do you actually eat meat or fish by itself? Hardly ever right? You have other ingredients right?? 
Vegetables are healthy and they can taste nice by themselves. Its ironic people say going vegan is limiting when it comes to food, i find the opposite to be true."

"Climate change is nothing more than fear mongering. ""OMG GUYS WE'RE GONNA DIE IN 20 YEARS!!! NO NO 10 YEARS!!!"" People have been saying those words ever since the 1980's like that time everybody said we would die of climate change in 2000. Guess what? It's been over 20 years and it still hasn't happened. In fact, people complained about global cooling in the 1970's for Christ's sake. Climate change and global warming is just another part of Earth's cycle and the consequences of that will become a problem in AT LEAST a few dozen thousand years."

  Advanced X-ray technologies provide insights into a bacterial enzyme that converts methane into liquid fuel
 Methane-eating bacteria are found in harsh environments such as geothermal hot springs.
  Bacteria that metabolize methane (methanotrophs) are found in soil and aquatic environments with little or no oxygen.  In these anaerobic habitats, bacteria play a critical role in carbon recycling.  They convert methane (CH4) into more useful molecules that they and other organisms depend on.

  This research was a collaboration between scientists at Berkeley Lab, University of Minnesota, Stockholm University, SLAC and Diamond Light Source"

That's hundreds of Billions of creatures, all over the planet, and a darn sight more CO2 than all the factories on Earth.

This is scary tbh ..for some reason i am excited too
"Way too simplistic. By your logic at the beginning, the thicker the layer of greenhouse gasses, the more infrared radiation will be reflected in the first place, therefore DECREASING the global temperature. It’s videos like these that cause misconceptions. You should have mentioned that when the radiation is reflected from the earths surface, it has a slightly different wavelength (explaining this phenomenon)."

"What climate change is really causing is temperature extremes on both ends. Our summers are getting hotter and our winters are getting colder. This is bad for agriculture.

Even if the ice caps melt completely that's only going to raise the ocean 230 ft. Only places to the lower altitudes in that will be in danger. Mostly coastal regions. Get out of your big cities and you'll be just fine

I call BS. Where is the sea level rising?. Name one coast that has higher water levels at the shore.. I believe some storms are more severe and can go further inland and also erosion may change the coast. Water seeking to always level itself would affect all world oceans and seas. Only land locked bodies of water could have varying water levels. DW please don't pander to the climate change fear. [unless your forced to].

Concrete is not sustainable and contributes to 10% of world CO2 levels.
"... ""sea levels are set to rise further..."" says the narrator. Yet they haven't risen at all. Name one costal city anywhere in the world that is underwater... I have not seen a single city constructing a wall to keep the sea out. If this catastrophe were real, they all would be doing it."
"Then what about the coral reefs and other marine lives that sit beneath this floating cities? You may have a home, but you sacrifice everything."
"It is an exciting development, especially countries like Maldives which are facing severe floods. On the other hand it is sad to hear that coral reefs are dying because of the flooding houses’ pipe waste."
"I've always thought about this, is anything stopping island nations from buying disused cargo ships, tankers or cruise ships to build a floating city? Cruise ships especially are already complete and habitable from the get go, but would still need some work to make it acceptable for long term housing. We know they are seaworthy, the engineering behind them is more than proven, so why waste time and energy trying to come up with a solution when one is already staring them right in the face?

Instead of having the ships broken apart for scrap metal in very dangerous and toxic conditions in 3rd world countries, wouldn't it be better to just repurpose and reuse existing ships? There would still be some large investment needed to modernize them to modern living standards, improved waste water treatment and autonomous power generation, but it would still be cheaper on the long run, I think.

I'd appreciate it if someone with a brighter mind than my simple one would be so kind to tell me if this would be feasible or not."

I've been making prototypes of this concept for decades and I've been advocating for the abolishment of disposable diapers since they were commercialized.

"Between 13900 BC and 14000 BC, a 100 year span, Earth's temperature rose 5 degrees Celsius. This is one of many intermediate spikes in the ice core data, not including the 10-15 degree Ice Age spikes. Humanity lived through this periods just fine and had no heavy polluting industry to speak of at that time.  In the past 200 years, which is twice that length of time, Earth's temperature has only risen by 1.2 degree Celsius. 

A minor natural change in temperature that is in fact physically unstoppable and inevitable has been pathologized and blamed entirely on human activity in order to establish a carbon tax which allows governments to monitor every action of every person and tax them for it. The climate changes. Changes in local weather ARE NOT evidence of climate change, however, human activity CAN affect weather. 

Changes in climate, not weather, are driven by the Milankovitch cycles, primarily precession of the equinox, which changes the angle of Earth's tilt over a 25,000 year cycle, and thus changes the total amount of sunlight the poles receive, known as the insolation cycle. This insolation data from ice cores coincides directly with the rise and fall of the past 4 Ice Ages. Furthermore, CO2, methane, AND temperature were all higher than it is now prior to the last 4 ice ages, and also coincide with the insolation cycle and the rise and fall of the Ice Ages. That's right, CO2 and methane were higher back when humans were hunting wooly mammoths than they are now. No heavy industry to speak of. If no other fact about climate change remains in your memory, let that be the one. 

This fact suggests that the warming we are experiencing now is that final spike of warming that occurs right before Ice Ages suddenly set in. Climate change is real, its not caused by humans, and we are headed into a regularly scheduled Ice Age according to every indicator, not a waterball Earth condition where the remaining icecaps in the already warm period were in fully melt away. Sea level rise cannot occur with slow melting because of isostatic rebound. Rapid melting is required to cause the floods and sea level rises that climate extremists harp on about.
Rapid melting is caused by a sudden addition of lots of heat to the atmosphere. This is how the Ice Ages end. The most popular 

 If we were to somehow try and affect these Milankovitch cycles, such as slowing down the rate of precession, it would spell real cataclysmic changes to Earth's surface, the likes of which climate extremists only dream of to justify the implementation of their carbon tax scheme"

"The U.N. report also indicates that, long before the climate change food source effects are at their doomsday level, socio-political reaction to the near-term impact will devolve into global war.  The human race is still its own worst enemy.  I believe that some amount of funds allocated to thwart global warming should also be aimed at preserving the populous so that there will be future generations around to continue the generational effort it will take to stabilize the world's environment.   The Earth will survive the human race may not. 

 All I am saying is give peace a chance.  China, Russia, India, Pakistan and the U.S. will have to cooperate to accomplish anything.  Either that or build a bunker with a lot of frozen food and a solar powered freezer."
"Chaos Theory is essential to understanding the true nature of climate change, and the hysteria around geoengineering is dangerously counter-productive since climate models have to account for the fact that we've already randomly geoengineered the crap out of the Earth, so isn't it high time we start doing it in a considered and productive fashion?"

"Everyone is just sitting back and throwing in the towel and, still, still, letting the oil companies and ***holes do what they want."

"Hm, just some quick corrections.
Those things are not irreversible, I mean, there was a time when the planet was 8° warmer and it was just fine, even great, and it changed to today's level, the actual problem is ""change"" and ""speed of change"", not ""warming"" by itself. Species are alive or extinct, so irreversible, but temperatures are irreversible only in 100-1000 years time-period, which is quite short to be honest.
We would probably still be on mass extinction line even without warming as humans do tend to directly and indirectly kill quite a lot on yearly basis, the warming is just the most ""global"" extinction event, but it is more ""whatever we are already doing + warming"". Like, deep-sea-mining is just about to start, an entirely new habitat to annihilate, we are doing such things closer to us for quite some time (Fertile crescent is a funny word, I wonder where that came from).
Sea-line is one such example, it is not really important where it is, a meter up or down, irrelevant, but we tend to like for it to stay where it is, because that is where most of our infrastructure (like homes) is.
Deep-sea-current sounds like something that would start again once melting stops, there is only so much ice to melt so sooner or later (probably soon) yearly balance will again be reached, but that of course doesn't mean that is ok, even a year without would be quite devastating from ocean-ecosystem point of view. Also ... if there is all that ""mini-ice-age"" thing going on, it sounds like a great way to pull fresh water out of the sea for a moment and kick-start the current again. It sounds more important how much of a difference there is between polar and equatorial water temperatures, so there would be this push-pull force going on and here could be some problems, polar regions are warming faster, but I don't know enough about that to say something about it.
I would like for you to mention acidification of oceans, that one sounds more problematic, given that it might be harder for animals to adapt to, or at least I have a hard time imagining how they would do that.
Anyway, nice video :)"
Propaganda is strong with this one… hmmm
"We need to mitigate damage with action fast. We need to gray up roof tops, parking lots and highways. The impact would be huge. We need to create calcium clouds in the oceans (watch Ice on Fire; an RIT Croatia professor explains it) to suck CO2 from the air. We need to fertilize the dead areas in the oceans with iron to suck billions of tons of CO2 from the air and feed the invertebrates. We need to switch from beef to fish and we need to grow food instead of lawns."
What a load of rubbish.
"I give the human race three, maybe four generations, max."
Total BS the climate hoax is just that. A hoax!
"and this is all done by humans..the cabal and their elites behind the curtains have planned this..they are at the other continents while we are being killed here..just ask the weathercontrol mil dept. they know how to change weather, they have done this moestly.. storms etc. it is well known and documented and kept at secrest places, so we know afterwards who did what on purpose. So its time to stop these weathercontrollers and those who give the orders...don't we?! Then we might make it.."
"I'd say we are already on the tipping point in many areas.
1) Permafrost is thawing at record speeds releasing more GHG's to the atmosphere (100-1000GtCO2e). This leads to wast areas being taken from the permafrost to the melted ground. Also we have found that rains and warm weather also drains lakes faster than previously thought.
2) Greenland ice sheet has most likely gone over its tipping point and will melt during next few centuries.
3) Arctic sea ice is getting thinner and arctic has heated 4 times faster than rest of the world. Partially tipped already. Like Barents sea is mostly ice free.
4) Forests like Amazon, boreal forests and many other have tipped at least part of the year to the state where it produces more carbon than what sinks there. We are losing too many forests that were a major carbon sink.
5) We are losing coral reefs already at record speed. 50% of the Great Barrier reef is dead and more bleeching events are coming almost every year. Almost all reefs has bleached at some level already.
6) Droughts. There are several areas in the world that are on going yearly droughts. Some have been under drought conditions for decades, some years and in this year many areas have been affect simultaniously. US west is on megadrought, Africa is on drought, mediterraneian area is on drought, Pakistan drought with extreme flooding, remember Australian wildfires, ...
7) Mountain glaciers are under tipping points in many areas. In Europe Alps are losing all glaciers and this year was one of the worst, yet. Rocky mountains in USA are losing glaciers, see ""glacier park"" that is losing its glaciers fast or what is happening to the Colorado river. Himalayas are losing some of its glaciers and main river are drying up. Andies are losing glaciers and some cities are threatened because there is no alternative water sources. Even places like Canada and Alaska are losing their glaciers. Swedens highest point was changed due to melting glacier. ...

You may add most of the animals to the mix if you want. But that's not only a climate issue. Sixth mass extinction needs its own talks.

Even with these on going tipping points, we still emit even more emissions this year. And likely next year. And year after that. Pure madness that is heading to over 4C (pledges will not be fulfilled) world with tipping elements that are rising temperatures even further.."
I've read this is a natural occurrence over millions of years and the earth has gone through this many times even before us...so have we helped? I'm sure we have but with billions/trillions of people trying to live and survive that's expected
The results of capitalism folks. Wake up.
A warning system will be ignored until it has been swept away by the storms and tides if the people think as today's chambers of commerce .
"There's more and more evidence that the planets climate is predominantly driven by changes in solar output and by atmospheric particulates. CO2 is way down the list. Bad science followed by an ""environmental movement"" hijacked by Big Business and dirty politicians."
With any hope humans do nothing. So until they stop giving hope we will do NOTHING. This dream we have of adapting and finding gains in this change is the reason we won’t do shit. Good luck.
It's the feedback loops that will really get us. Afro-Eurasia will be particularly screwed. Not just because of the direct physical effects but the demographic challenges that will come with it. It's one of the big reasons I don't live in Europe anymore.

Wow you're so far off it's not even funny once you get your real science
"Global climate changes have been going on for millions if not BILLIONS of years. Climates change fast or slow as nature provides for. A lot is dependant on earthquake, volcanic activity and changes in ocean currents. Humans have no more effect on this planet than fleas do to a dog."

"At the beginning of 'climate awareness', I read that the most commonly grown types of wheat are dependent on a narrow temperature range. The report said that if our climate changes 3 degrees C, the world's wheat crop would fail. I haven't found a similarly based study on rice yet."
"I'm 83 now.  I had had 2 children before hearing of global warming.  At that point I determined to have no more children.  I later married 2 childless men (not at the same time 🤓), and had no more children.  Being so close to the end of my life, I hope to miss the worst of the looming disaster.  Unfortunately, my great-grandaughter will live it. 😢"
"maiya may, you may want to mention what's or who is actually causing this extreme warmer now. that would be a good starter bc w/o calling out the culprits, i.e. shell, bp, exxon, chevron; along with the largest polluter of them all, the US military industrial complex, which emits as much pollution into the atmosphere than 140 countries combined. plus this system called capitalism and its constant accumulation of wealth and overproduction is the dark hands behind it all. 
so there it is. this what it will take for us to make the changes to stop warming at 1.5-2°c.  end this war machine, stop funding fossil fuel fcukers with $6trillion dollars and change this greed system called capitalism that ensures the destruction of its two most important resources, humans and mother earth."
explain how they find these average temperatures
These things are natural ice melts we’re do you think our fresh water comes from.
Would another 1815 type/size of eruption that covered the globe in ash and blotted out the sun for a summer actually help cool down some stuff significantly enough for the systems to try to start to repair themselves?

"Human kind's desperate belief that money (which now essentially exists as data on hard drives) is the most important thing in the universe is what is going to kill us. Unless we can change the culture of Profit At All Costs, we're f'd."

Me and my family do do a lot to lessen our impact but we're still way off where we need to be. So my vision for the future is bleak. I look at these problems you portrayed so well and I don't see us coming together to tackle them.
Geo-engineering is real . Global warming … not so much
One thing we could do is to stop jealous haters from dissing Greta Thunberg.
"We already have emitted far too much of the carbon budget we needed to stay within to keep warming below 2° C. The current emissions path will produce 3° C or more of warming by 2100, pushing us over the tipping points mentioned in this video plus others we have not yet imagined. 

An existential calamity for civilization is unfolding before our eyes, yet even most of us who recognize it are failing to change our behavior. We keep taking trips in jet airplanes, heating and cooling our homes to ideal temperatures, driving single-occupancy vehicles instead of using public transportation, eating food carried to our markets from thousands of miles away, and so on. As long as most of the wealthy portion of humanity continues to behave this way, we must expect to pass these tipping points and more, with disastrous results for ourselves and our children."
Climate changes. Always has and always will regardless of humans. The powers that be are just using it as an excuse to gain more power and subjugate more people. Literally every dire prediction has failed so far. It is all BS. The most terrifying thing is seeing how many weak minded people are so easily brainwashed into all of this.
My village fell into the sea :(
the image is so diring that we'll just have to live with it as changes happens. it is really sad that we are destroying so much of our own planet just for selfish reasons. make more meaningless personal wealth accumulate money... once dead we can't take our money with us...
"I think as a human being who hasnt been around on this planet very long, trying to quantify what changes you see in the planet which are constantly occuring whether or not the human species is present, simply are going to be inaccurate and fallible.  As humans we need to adjust to a changing planet and realize we dont control nature as much as we think we do.  In short you people who think you are smart are probably the dumbest ones out there."
"The elephant in the room is that actual consensus has always been 1.5°C - 2.0°C. The figure of 4°C was always on the extreme limit but was politically favored because of scientists were being accused of being "" alarmists ""."
"Since we are much pretty much at or near the tipping point, I say we just drive our gas guzzlers and deal with Armageddon when  it arrives. If we can't beat it, let's join it."
Look UP and see what is causing the climate to warm. Geoengineering operations are killing everything.
Ireland is currently making contingency plans for migration from the UK. Quarter of a million Brits have already moved there.
"The planet was in the past much hoter and with zero ice. So nature will be there, just different. Humans cannot put a stop to the weather they like (as a snowboarder, I am sad too). So the bottom line is that all this climate change issue is about human livelihood and economy, not about ""saving the planet"". Let's plan for adaptation and not arrogant, unrealistic, wasteful, and destructive Don Quixote ""efforts"" to stop what is unstoppable."
It can be done! Free electricity that Nikolai Tesla reinvented rather then burning fossil fuel ⛽️
"Until the day each of us do not produce garbage in our houses, have houses completely off grid, do not produce warming gases, our feeding being more organic and less producer of pollution, be more minimalistic, the businesses and companies produce without polluting and the governments stop weapons and wars, and have the routine of doing something active that directly improves the environment until that moment this circle of global warming will stop. So is probably that we won ever stop doing all those things. 🤷‍♂️"
Scientist have actually identified the fact that so called tipping points are incredibly rare in complex systems such as the earth's atmosphere. I just smell more BS and hysteria over a warming climate that is coming out of an ice age and therefore will warm regardless of how we generate energy. You're being manipulated and shackled by the Carbon tax on life
Truth heating the entire world just a single degree can have terrible effects for the world we are starting to enter into the world wide mass extension event of all species
The solution. A nonstop solar powered ice maker strategically placed on the north pole. 😂
"In general I'm in favour of CO2 emmisions cut in order not to warm too fast. But there are very interesting news regarding AMOC - from the movie I can conclude that we will warm up to 2degrees above the reference, then AMOC would stop and will cool us down and then it will start again when reference levels would be there.
Or perhaps we will finally stop the glacial periods and enter again the warm, humid Earth era with tropical rainforests covering even Greenland like it was during Mesosoic era and actually 99,2% of Earth's existence taking into account 3,8 billion years when life exists on our planet."
Polar axis is shifting. 😱😱😱

"1. TAX the rich proportionately to their profits
2. Make mass media truthfully report on this EVERY day 
3. Drastically reduce consumption of energy 
4. Phase out fossil fuels and transit to renewables
5. Ensure the public support by just and fair access to food, shelter, energy and education
Mentioned changes are applicable only by the state as governing body of nations.
General public therefore needs to enter into civil resistance to ensure these changes are applied."

This is almost criminal in its understatement of what's going to happen. How do they leave out the ohc and thermal inertia
And Einstein theory of quantum radiation disproves CO2 can trap heat. Then there's planks law and weins law. Disprove them and then I'll believe this is man made. Remember also that CO2 can only absorb radiation at 2 frequencies. Not all radiation is trapped by CO2. Time to wake up people.....
"that is tolate but all lands need to stop useing coal  USA relly need to step an get windmills other things that do not leads out carbon 
USA is in huge areas like the Stone age you th republicans for that they refuse to adapt to the problems in the world sadly.

China an india also both of them we get hit very hard in the comming years an they keep consume more an more olie  right now they get it very cheap from Russia they will be the reisen we endt on the 3 degrees sadly but True bacse they are the 2 contrys thats do less then the rest an dosen even show they care just look at what happen with Pakistand an in India they also get heat wave like never before an they still dont get it they keep lead out Huge amound of Carbon same do china  an still use alot of coal.

its to late its already startet i am sad on behaf of our childen becase people are just to late out this was already know in the 1960 the problem no one took this seruis an people only look for profits  so now we are here an there is northing we can do now."

You should also look at the suns activity and the weakening magnetic field.  This causal warm is nothing compared to a mini super nova hitting us.
I've been studying this stuff since the 1970s. These people are hilarious they know nothing of what they're speaking.
"I was born in 1987 and looking back at what was happening around that time, it seemed as if humanity was going to get everything under control. Sensible people would act back then, but they stopped, and humanity got stupider and stupider, and stupider from there. The fact that we haven’t done anything really, even until now despite how much worse everything has got; and the fact that we are still making basically no progress politically, or in terms of reducing consumption shows that so clearly. Realistically, I can’t say I have much faith in humans. But I am an idealist, and I’d love to see us all wake up tomorrow, basically remove the capitalists from mainstream society and any political power somehow (because they’ll never change) and save ourselves. I hope so, but every day we keep going on like this, the hope goes down another notch. That’s the unfortunate truth, that every day matters and we’re doing nothing at all relatively speaking."
To address global warming it is essential to explore various solutions beyond those presented in the video
"The big problem is everything you make change to the environment you make it worse . There is no time now. Scientist keep saying , they need fact and proof. Waiting for that proof , its all comes to late. Shut the gate after the horse has bolted as they saying goes. I was saying all about this 40 yeas ago and got laughed at. now look where we are."
lol the only possible way to solve climate change is by everybody going vegan no joke.
we are all waiting.  waiting for climate change to be solved. people have made progress.  but it's  not enough.   we need to do more. but I'm afraid that it won't be solved in time at the rate were going at.  maybe we might solve it. but solve it too late. we really need to act now!
REAL CHANGE IS GLOBALISTS STEALING TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF HUMANITY.... INSTEAD they could solve world hunger and other pressing issues....
This is so stupid. To think that MAN is going to effect the natural climate cycles is really overestimating the impact of humans.
Too late.
I know how to bring cheep electricity and cut all those climate control deal's. Musk needs to rejump start the Tesla free electricity. Of course we will need lot's more tower's like the pyramids in every country and states. Number of them? I have 0 idea of that. Free is always better
"Global warming has nothing to do with auto exhaust or emissions. There has been a substantial rise in volcanic activity over the last hundred years especially in the oceans. This has increased the temperature of the land, the sea, and the air. The earth's climate is most likely changing back to what it was 2,000 years ago when it was much warmer. When the Romans were in Britain (40BC-380AD) they grew citrus fruit in the north."
"can I have the narration, please?"
Who ever disliked this is an idiot! I looked it up and 97% of scientists who study in the field of clumsy change believe it is caused/ helped by humans!

Everyday, thousands of people die. Death is everywhere, but only together we can make a difference. Will you die out because you do not fear death? Because YOLO. There is no such thing as reincarnation, etc. The goal in life is survival, and to fight the enevitable death, for those who give up are sloths and simply watch days go by. We are slowly making advancement and time is running out... Unless you have already dug your own grave."

"It's sad that channels like National Geographic stoop to doomsday prophecies. They should know that climate has always changed. Not just that, land masses move, water masses move--it's all natural. Stop being afraid that the world is going to end just because we have a hot summer or a cold winter or a hurricane. ""Water shortages""?? NG should know water evaporates, condenses into clouds, then precipitates in rain. You can't get rid of water! Get a grip folks. And stop pushing ""solutions"" to problems that don't exist, like reductions in C02 emissions. C02 is used by plants during photosynthesis to produce sugar (which feeds the plants) and oxygen (which we breathe). More C02 helps plants grow. And no C02, as pushed by Bill Gates, would mean death of all plants and all life on earth. Get a grip people. Stop being afraid. Everything will be okay."

Let see did NGS pay these trolls?
None of this will make a difference.
Why is National Geographic so grossly stupid? Time they are held accountable for that lie.
"We need to stop animal agriculture. It is the source of 51% of greenhouse gases. It is unsustainable, and the only way to slow down global warming significantly would be to go vegan."

hoax
"As is to be expected the lies are front and center.

The “hottest summers” are exclusively the result of data manipulation. Outside of the urban heat sinks 13 of those 15 “hottest summers” were below the historic average.

 Carbon is NOT a greenhouse gas. Most empirical evidence proves that the planet has had significantly HIGHER levels of carbon for the majority of the geological epochs. The releasing of carbon from its sequestration will INCREASE plant growth and expand the usable zone of farming.

The UN IPCC is NOT a scientific body but is in fact a political organization who has the internal mandate to maintain the economic status quo."
"Global warming is a significant issue caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels. To address it, we should shift to cleaner energy sources like solar and wind power, improve energy efficiency, and consider carbon taxation. Electric vehicles and public transportation can help reduce emissions.

In addition to technological solutions, reforestation and waste reduction are crucial. International cooperation is essential, as is educating the public about climate change. Continued innovation in sustainable technologies is also necessary.

Collectively, these efforts can help mitigate global warming and protect our planet."
"This documentary isn’t realistic.

"WOW. I see more people in the comments who are completely and totally scientifically illiterate. They have no understand of physic, chemistry, biology or geology. Please do yourself a favor, and educate yourself on scientific subjects, so you can actually read data and understand for yourself, being a scientifically literate person.

 If you understand physics and chemistry, you will understand the world around you. If you study biology, you will understand animals and plants, and with chemistry, you will even know what they are made of. If you study geology, or other geosciences, you will understand the fundamentals of the planet and how it behaves. Then you won't have to post comments like these below, about not trusting politicians (?), who are not scientists in the first place. SMH.

And the scientifically illiterate people are almost always talking about ""global warming"", instead of climate change, completely unaware and oblivious that they are not the same thing at all. I am so disappointed to see how many scientifically illiterate people are out there, and I really hope they are not in my country (United States). It concerns me deeply for the future, even if we were talking about simple chemistry they simply have no clue, and these people are not students, they are scientifically illiterate adults  -_-"
"Yes, there is climate change; it is real, and it is serious. AND THERE IS NOT ONE SOLITARY THING WE CAN DO TO AFFECT IT!! And there is not one single thing we have ever done to affect it! THE SUN CONTROLS IT ALL!! It is insanity to believe WE have anything to do with climate!!! Even the largest volcanic eruptions only have an effect for a couple years! What HUBRIS to think we can do anything to help or hurt the climate!"

"How to Win The Climate Change Debate Every time
            There are many common beliefs about what climate change actually is. This is a problem that is specific to this current generation due to the technological advances that are supposedly the cause. There is a high amount of activism going on about stopping man-made climate change, but I'm going to show you why this is a waste of time. Climate change and global warming are not the same things.
Let's look at the definitions. Based on Global Warming the unabridged guide...""Global Warming is the rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and it's projected continuation."" This rise in temperature is due to the activities of humans and that is from a 95% consensus from scientist on a U.N. panel. In short the definition of global warming is that the actions of humans are causing the earth to get hotter and it will eventually lead to the end of the earth. It is not the same thing as climate change. Climate change is something that has been going on since the beginning of time. It is the natural fluctuation of the earth's climate. We don't have any control of it. For example, who cause who caused the ice age? Was it the dinosaurs? Who brought us out of the ice age? Was it the first human settlers that caused the earth to thaw by their smoke signal and camp fires harming the ozone layer? If you think about if longer than two minutes you will realize it's not likely.
The first claim I will debunk is this. Cow flatulence is causing the Ozone later to open and cause global warming. Many of you may feel this is just a ridiculous claim that I am making up. If only that was the case. The White House wants to regulate cow farts. Vaccines are even being developed to decrease the amount of greenhouse gases(cattle flatulence) being emitted. Australian farmers are even signing their sheep and cattle up to get vaccinated for this purpose.
Let's use common sense. If cow or cattle flatulence is so dangerous to this planet, what happened when the dinosaurs were around? Dinosaurs are said to have roamed the planet for 165 million years. Over the span of 165 million years you can safely figure that the accumulated population of dinosaurs exceeds that of cows and other cattle of this present time. You can also safely figure that dinosaurs are multiple times more massive than cows and any other animal on this planet. We could look at the recent discovery of the Titanosaurus for reference. This is said to be the largest animal to ever walk the planet. The point is that the dinosaurs would have emitted more greenhouse gases than cows due to their gargantuan size. They also would have emitted more gas over a time of 165 million years. According to the original claim this should have caused many massive holes in the ozone layer. As you can see the earth is not a ball of flames, and not only that but we had an ice age. We should have had an extremely hot age with those high amount of global warming causing factors.But we did not. Simply put, the ice age we had was natural climate change. This climate change happens without the actions of humans. Another point you must consider is how we left the ice age, surely is was not because of the camp fires of settlers emitting gases into the ozone later.
The second claim is that human caused global warming is causing the polar bears to almost go extinct. The idea is that global warming is melting the polar ice caps and is destroying their environment. This is causing them to die and even eat one another. The polar bear has been the mascot for the cause of global warming for many years but when looking at the numbers, the claims do not add up. In the 1950's it was reported that there are 5,000 to 10,000 living polar bears in the world. In the year 2014, it is reported that there are 22,600 to 32,000 living polar bears on the planet. That is four times the amount from the 1950's. As far as their habitat is concerned, in 2007 Al Gore spoke intensely about scientific research he had seen and predicted the entire north polar ice caps will vanish. If we look at the data from 2013 we actually see that the polar ice caps are still there and they have increased from the last year.
The third claim is that we actually have to take action to stop global warming. There are billions of dollars being spent and solution being created to stop global warming. Politicians are making speeches about going green by using wind and solar power so we can cut down carbon emissions. This sounds nice and I would love to have every home powered by solar panels but if this is solely because of global warming then there is a problem. Global warming has been on a 17 years plus pause. According to NASA it's been for 17 years and six months. If we bring it up to date we see its been 17 years and nine months. This is startling information considering the growth of the population. More people means more carbon emissions going into the atmosphere. That means we should see more global warming. More global warming would bring a hotter earth  and we would see a continuous increase in temperature every year. That has not been the case with this 17 year pause. We also have more cars on the road than ever. According to a study by Wards Auto, the population of cars on the road is over one Billion. We see an increase in global warming causing factors, but no increase in temperature. If you haven't noticed, we have experienced record-breaking cold temperatures recently around the world. For example, it recently snowed in Egypt for the first time in 112 years."
What if it's the sun that's getting hotter?
UR NOT MY DAD!!
Remember Y2K when all the computers were supposed to crash because of year 2000. Never happened but a lot of computer consultants made a fortune preparing for this non existent threat.

"N                                         Global Warming Will End---God's Way

     The Bible tells us that ""the former of the earth and the Maker of it.... did not create it simply for nothing."" (Isaiah 45:18) The Bible also says: ""The earth endures forever."" ---Ecclesiastes 1:4, The New English Bible. 

     Yes, God will not allow the earth to be rendered uninhabitable. Rather, he will intervene in human affairs and bring an end to failed human rule and those who have no regard for the earth. At the same time, he will preserve alive all who lead morally upright lives and sincerely want to please him. Saya Proverbs 2:21, 22: ""The upright are the ones that will reside in the earth, and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it. As regards the wicked, they will be cut off from the very earth, and as for the treacherous, they will be torn away from it."""

Very Informative but there is no sean s
all I have to say is if saving the is manedtorey to save the planet why does it cost so much what is the propose of making that money if your not going to live much longer
"I dont buy it
It was really f*cking cold yesterday"
My dad said it's not true that humans can cause climate change. He said it's cuz the Earth is orbiting closer and closer to the Sun. And we don't have to save papers because paper companies grow many trees to make papers. :(

"The world is supposedly millions of years old, but we are led to believe that you only need to go back 2 decades to prove climate change. Hmmm."
"Why did they change the clarion call of ""Global Warming"" to ""Climate Change""?  To hide the ""Inconvenient Truth"" of PROOF!  The Climate is evolving all over the Earth rather than a simple heating up of the entire planet.  In 50 years GW will fade away into another politically convenient cause to rally the masses against another invisible Boogey Man."

I'm eating a big fat steak right now. Chew on that cud you vagen cowspiracists.
400 ppm is not enough for 7 billion people. 1000 ppm is more like it. More carbon in the air means more people will have food on the table. More carbon = plant booming. The eugenicists don't want more carbon as it means more people. More people = more control problem. They want you sandboxed.

"Climate change is real, YEH! But it's not caused by us!!!! Its a natural shift, from solar-cycles and cosmic radiation. We are not heading  a warmer climate; that's a big political and economic LIE! We are heading for a little ice-age. Before this period climat is warming up. Extremes will increase. And than, in a few years, very cold winters, floods and other colling-down-symptoms are happening. Sorry for my English. YOU WILL SEE BETWEEN 2016 and 2015!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

AS FOR BIG BUISNESS, GOVERMEANT ,BANKS, the powers that be, they have never given a shit and they never truely will ,because of money ,, i mean fuck me , if they really wanted to they could sort all issues out tomorrow if thet truely cared ,but of course thet wont  because were stuck in the money rut,they worry about economy , they worry about lining there own pockets , they put a price tag on everything , which is so not the way to go, oh i could go on but whats the point ,,the problems are clear as day and blatently obviose, they just havnt a clue , ......"
"Let's take today's temperature in your city. Then we take this same day and check the data 80 years ago and see that the temperature was the same, and sometimes even higher, many years ago. Here's some warming for you. Even if the average temperature has risen by one degree in 100 years, this is a stupid reason to panic and blame humanity for this. Are you suggesting to reduce the population or what? Then many people will not support your crazy and useless ideas, ""scientists""."
"It seems to me that history is repeating itself. Empires (consumerism, greed and corruption of the elite) collapse and disappear.

We are the victim of global warming
This is propaganda intended to scare people to give up their energy for global control and wealth redistribution.
"What do we want? Less co2
OK lets reduce co2, and start with china..

Ehm but ehhh then we dont get any stuff? And we want stuff.
And a lot of things are produced in china..

Man made
Any word from Parker solar probe I honestly believe the sun is getting brighter
Dear all members of DW you don't have the courage to stop global warming. This really isn't the way to stop the global warming.
The White European wealthy countries will make drastic changes and helpful decisions meanwhile the 'poor' third world countries will keep dragging their feet and blaming the 'West' for all their problems. Asking for billions in climate aid which their billionaire leaders will pocket for themselves!
Lies...all lies
The effects of climate change are just starting. Its a scary future.
I read something online about how the USA have billions of barrels of oil locked away. If DW would consider investigating resource hoarding that would be appreciated.
"Nikita Zimov and his father run Pleistocene Park in Russia, and are trying to bring back wildlife to help stop the degradation on permafrost, all from their own pockets. There's a really good movie about them that is available of vice. Highly recommend! The amount of resiliance and perserverance is insane!"
"A 50% reduction in GHG.??   Not going to happen; China building more coal plants, India ditto, then there is Africa with all of them wanting Western world lifestyles !  Get ready for more warmth, failing crops, worldwide wars and starvation !"
"Heatwaves are not caused by climate change. Its a natural temperature phenomenon. There are over 300 severe heatwave incidents recorded since 1540. Furthermore there are Greek and Roman scripts describing extreme heat temperatures in ancient years.

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"The companies, are only interested in keeping making money, money,money...

About the impact in climate for them doesn't count...
Now we are suffering....
Experts are saying that 2023  is the hottest year  since people started to register the temperature...
And this greedy attitude Will continue until the Sistema stays up
But soon the Sistema will go down
Ask me WHY..."
ARSON IS NOT CLIMATE CHANGE
"Ecclesiastes 1:4 A generation is going, and a generation is coming, But the earth remains forever.     Isaiah 45:18,, Jehovah says, The Creator of the heavens, the true God,,,,,Who did not create it simply for nothing, but formed it to be inhabited: “I am Jehovah, and there is no one else.   More good news!! Psalms 37:29,34 The righteous will possess the earth, And they will live forever on it. [...] 34 Hope in Jehovah and follow his way, And he will exalt you to take possession of the earth. When the wicked are done away with, you will see it."
"Revelation 11:15 The seventh angel blew his trumpet. And there were loud voices in heaven, saying: “The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king forever and ever.” 16 And the 24 elders who were seated before God on their thrones fell upon their faces and worshipped God,  17 saying: “We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king.  18 But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time came for the dead to be judged and to reward your slaves the prophets and the holy ones and those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.”"
Very important video! And we’ll made!  Thanks!
Telling the ever-hungry to stop eating will never happen; we'll just have to adapt to a warming world.
"A completely hopeless venture - I live in a country that is in fourth place in terms of forest area in the European Union - approximately 53% of the country's territory is forests. And what is the benefit to us as citizens of the country? 1935 we had strong agriculture and then forests were about 27%. And they also tell us that we need to live even greener, etc. industry has strict rules, because you see - they create CO2 and know what problems there are - our government signed some kind of nightmares that by 2030 we undertake to partially switch to cars with electric engines - forget it - we just had to sign something and did it - today is 2023. and it doesn't look like electric car charging points will be created in my country. Besides, if I were to switch from my Audi internal combustion engine to a very expensive electric car - then how would I charge it while living in an apartment on the fourth floor? :D
In addition, seeing the statistics - below 30% of the forest area are those countries that mass produce food products and derive income from it by exporting them to countries like mine where farmers are forced to fight for every area intended for agriculture - because they see the need to leave the forests, because some kind of global warming etc. - please Greece, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Romania, Poland, France and the other countries that do not have at least 40% of forest areas - reduce your agricultural activity, or share the profit with those countries that take care to have forests in Europe. Probably, if farmers in France are told that part of the profits must be returned to countries that take care of ecology by sacrificing their agricultural industry - I think that violent clashes would break out again in French cities.
That's why I say that I don't care at all, like the majority of people in my country, because we already live according to ecology as much as it is possible for a normal person."
The English voice-over on non-english speakers is one of the feature why I like DW.
"Im.not sire how much we will all need to do to avert climate change as I do believe that it is in a way getting worse because of our activities as the humans but climate change has been around since really forever. Our plan as a family is to do as much as possible to reduce our carbon footprint, and we will try and use less and less each year. I'm not sure what that will do, but atleast its something."
The Earth has had these same changes for millennia.  This has happened more than a thousand times. It's not the global warming that we made . We just helper  it along.
"To combat climate change these solutions that needed to be included:

Investing in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.
Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.
Improving energy efficiency in our homes and businesses.
Planting trees and other vegetation.
Reducing our consumption of meat and other animal products.
Changing our transportation habits."
When will these lies stop ?????????????????????
"Doc's like this are full of false hope(lies!?). There's nothing anybody can do. Corporate greed, profits are going to mess up the climate until Civilization Ends. Capitalism feeds on Earth (nature). Profits, profits, profits are all that matters!!!🤪🤪🤪.See if you can Stop the top 1 percent!!! Scientist can study, people can protest,do want you want!!!!🌎 you'll never stop it 🌎 it's already to late.
One more thing to note...
Young people claim to Care!!?😂yeah!!! Phones, social media, consumption, Amazon, TikTok,the next fad, consume, consume, consume...care!!!yeah right 🤪😂🤪😂
How much time we have??? Their world is gonna come crashing down on them and the they'll be crying over all the things they've lost while they PERISH!!!!!😂🌎🤪🌎😂🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔"
verting catastrophes are the worst kind
"The WEF rulers are laying out plans for you (the masses) to save the planet. Eventually, no personal cars, live and work in the 15-minute ghettos/cities, air travel will be restricted,  resort cruise ship trips restricted or eliminated, allocated a few pounds of meat in a year,  restricted purchase of clothes in a year,  and the list grows, You will own nothing and be happy."
"And about the Russians, all of their issues will just be worst (and most likely pulling us down with them, we should not forget aobut china's contribution to this), their leadership couldn't care about their issues, specially now in war times... so they will do the exact opposite to what needs to be done. Specially with all the sanctions that will continue to affect their country."
Sad thing is that Donald Trump and his supporters have no idea this is about!
How are u gonna « avert » mainly natural climate change ???  How come all those different climate doomsday predictors think they are next to Jesus on the pedestal ?  A little less arrogance wouldn’t hurt !
Still not hot enough! Sponsored by F**k Den Planeten.
"The problem is the word ""We"". China grew rich ignoring this, and while Russia and China (etc) threaten war, the west cannot let the western economy go to ruin. I can see the utter devastation of climate change, I think we ""should"" stop it ""if"" we can, but the word ""we"" is not one across the planet. If Putin forces us to burn coal again, it is his fault not ours, we cannot be puerile teens who are impractical. Putin wants to ruin our economy. Bill Gates wants net zero because he wants to ruin the western economy, I suspect because he wants to start war. In any event..... net zero might need to be put on hold because of Putin and China threatening war.  If we burn coal again I believe God will blame China and Putin, not the west. It is a truly terrible Catch-22."
Too many damn people on the planet. We're doomed.
Thanks a lot for making this documentary. It is very pertinent for all of us to work towards avoiding climate change and documentaries like this would definitely help common people like me to engage actively.
"Why don't you go after the Chinese or Indonesians....what are we not replacing trees as quick as we cut them down.....we have greener car engines, producing less emissions than ever before...EV's are not the way forward. They have their own problems....Net zero is not achieveable.....reduceable maybe......"
I'm not a scientist but it seems to me that Global Warming is just a natural cycle of the Earth. It's not like our education and technology has been around long enough time to record the Earth's climate changes since it's birth.
"Climate change has nothing to do with auto exhaust or emissions. There has been a substantial increase in seismic and volcanic activity over the last hundred years. This has increased the temperature of the land, sea, and air. The weather is most likely changing back to what it was 2,000 years ago. When the Romans were in Britain (40BC-380AD) they grew citrus fruit in the north. Look up ""Roman Warm Period"" and ""Medieval Warm Period"" online. It appears that there is a major change every 1,000 years and that is where we are today. Periodic change in the heat, light, and radiation created by the sun affects the earth both above and below and is the cause of the global warming we are experiencing."
Clmate and weather persist.
Every able bodied human can make a difference.
Only thing we’re not getting charged for on a free planet is air….Hold my beer.
"Methane gas is the big issue, because the animals from CFOA'S  (10 Billion annually, 90% Factory farmed,  in the U.S.) that we eat are fed crap instead of real grass. 
Livestock ""feed"" messes up their stomachs, (because their stomach are not designed to digest it) causes inflammation, infections and lots of gas.
Livestock feed contains:
-GMO Cereal grains, that are sprayed  with Glycosphate and which are commonly contaminated with up to 300ppb of Mycotoxins, or more(human limit is 30 ppb mycotoxins) yet we eat the animal?!
-""Corn"" which is the by product waste from Ethanol production and Corn oil refinery processes that uses Hexane.
-Brewers grains and yeasts from the manufacturing of alcohol products.
-GMO sugar beet pulp and waste from the refinement and bleaching of cheap sugar.
-Pineapple skin and cores, ""bran"" to make the constipated animals poop.
-Any byproduct waste from the process of human grade food can be added to livestock and pet food.

-Then petroleum based bioengineered synthetic chemical ""vitamins"", antibiotics and synthetic estrogens for quicker weight gain are added to the mix.
Yum ! 😋  
Are you eating these sick and miserable animals? That is why you are sick. 
Eat grass fed pastured, humanely cared for, animals. 

You don't need to eat meat everyday to be healthy. That idea is from brainwashing consumption advertising thinking."
Thanks so much for posting.
"climate fixers to block the sun;  hmmmmm, so what about solar panels to make 'green' energy then ?"
"What has happened in Switzerland , in the mountains. 5 meters of snow melted in just 5 months, plus 1 meter and 1/2 of ice.. That is Alarming. The only way to make those many meters of ice become ice again, it is to keep the sun away.  Make artificial clouds for a year."
I don’t give a rats about climate change. I care about corruption in media and government. We can’t trust politicians who keep throwing money at friends and relatives who pay for their campaigns.  We need a solution not propaganda.  So I don’t agree to get onboard with a bunch of alarmists who have no solutions.
"Ecological grief (or eco-grief), or in particular climate grief, refers to the sense of loss that arises from experiencing or learning about environmental destruction or climate change. Environmental grief can be defined as ""the grief reaction stemming from the environmental loss of ecosystems by natural and man-made events."" Another definition is ""the grief felt in relation to experienced or anticipated ecological losses, including the loss of species, ecosystems, and meaningful landscapes due to acute or chronic environmental change."" Environmental disruption, such as the loss of biodiversity, or even the loss of inanimate environmental features like sea ice, cultural landscapes, or historic heritage can also cause negative psychological responses, such as ecological grief or solastalgia. Solastalgia (/ˌsɒləˈstældʒə/) is a neologism, formed by the combination of the Latin words sōlācium (comfort) and the Greek root -algia (pain, suffering, grief), that describes a form of emotional or existential distress caused by environmental change. It is best described as the lived experience of negatively perceived environmental change. A distinction can be made between solastalgia linked to distress about what is in the process of negatively perceived change and eco-anxiety linked to what may happen in the future (associated with ""pre-traumatic stress"", in reference to post-traumatic stress). Eco-anxiety (short for ecological anxiety and also known as eco-distress or climate-anxiety) has been defined as ""a chronic fear of environmental doom"". Extensive studies have been done on ecological anxiety, and various definitions remain in use. Another widely cited definition is: ""the generalized sense that the ecological foundations of existence are in the process of collapse."" Some scholars use the term eco-anxiety as a synonym for climate-anxiety, while others like to treat the terms separately. While much ecological disruption results from climate change, some is caused by direct human activity, such as deforestation. The condition is not a medical diagnosis and is regarded as a rational response to the reality of climate change; however, severe instances can have a mental health impact if left without alleviation. There is also evidence that eco-anxiety is caused by the way researchers frame their research and their narratives of the evidence about climate change: if they do not consider the possibility of finding any solution to overcome climate change and for individuals to make a difference, they contribute to this feeling of powerlessness. Eco-anxiety is an unpleasant emotion, though it can also motivate useful behavior such as the gathering of relevant information. However, it can also manifest as conflict avoidance, or even be ""paralyzing"". The Holocene extinction, or Anthropocene extinction, is the ongoing extinction event during the Holocene epoch. The extinctions span numerous families of plants and animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, and affecting not just terrestrial species but also large sectors of marine life. With widespread degradation of biodiversity hotspots, such as coral reefs and rainforests, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be undocumented, as the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction, which goes unrecorded. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at hundred to thousand times higher than natural background extinction rates, and is increasing."
Ever consider that something more powerful and intelligent than man created this universe???
"There should be extra taxes for large industries since they primarily generate greenhouse emissions, not only educating people about how to save natural resources. Countries should push their governments demanding more rights and protection for the environment"
There is no such global warming show the fact😢 you can't st😮 pretending there is a climate change!!!
Rich can pay to go somewhere else
"A global cessation of births for several years at a time would be a good start to cut future emissions. It is logical. Eventually we can reach an equilibrium with nature in a few centuries of shrinkage. Possibly around the 500,000,000 to 1 billion number."
"propaganda... In the 80s they (academics in many areas) fossil fuels would end in 25 years, and this was at the time when China and India was not measured in the equation. Now after 30 few years, not only fossil fuels are still used but China and India are using so much of it, and no signs of fossil fuels ending.

So let's not get too hanged up on scientific predictions!"
Where does climate change come into this? The beginning  focused on the energy generation not what could affect this with the weather playing up and all?
We have only ourselves to blame😂😂😂😂
i think its too late to save the world...
"If Humanity stopped burning fossil-fuels Today, its already too late....but 30 million internal-combustion vehicles- New Vehicles - hit the road in 2022. We're fucked.

"We are driving straight into a tree, without changing direction fast enough, and some people arguing the tree is fake."
"It's sad to say but we can't do that. 
We have no time to reduce so much our emissions.
Not without destroying entire societies.
I mean, we have to cut fossil fuels for good. But we have no alternatives to produce energy. That means that if we enforce such changing, someone will have to return to the stone age. And of course no one will do that. In particular the most strongest countries on the planet that are, coincidentally, also the major responsables of such event.
In the end, if these countries don't stop, they will grant to surpass the point of no return and ultimately kill us all. While Earth is still able to change or recover, keeping life ""alive"", we humans are bounded to certain ecosistems and environments that are about to disappear. Such changing while irrelevant in the big picture of Earth biosphere, its absolutely imperative for us. It means extinction to us.
We can expect that billions of human beings will die between now and the next three or four decades.
And yet we have no alternatives. Nor plans to prevent such things to happen since, well... have you seen what's the trend now, right? ""Close borders to migrants"" is not a fairy tale, it's the real politic of many countries. So we are not even willing to help those who will suffer more for such crisis.
Why we should consider ourselves and our civilization worthy of surviving... I really don't know."
And how have been made all these concrete tunnels and metal pilones as well as plastic windmills? With what energy? How long are supposed to last all these infrastructures? Green growth doesn't exist...
at this point i would say that painting your roof white right now is way more important than planting trees. the main reason to paint surfaces white is to reflect short wave solar radiation back to space as short wave radiation. this is to make up for the massive ice loss around the world right now. the cooling affect is not why you do it. lobbing state gov and council to ban dark roofing is also a good idea
Are we to forever suffer through the Tales of Rat & Mouse?
That's why we're have war now so we can cut the population either way we're going to lose
"Govts must ratify climate legislations aiming at accomplishing sustainable development goals as enshrined in  UN directives.COp28 must work on total reduction of fossil fuels.common but differentiated responsibility does not work.1st world nations and industrialized nations consume a chunk of fossil fuels.afforestation initiatives,cleaning our oceans,protecting coral reef ecosystems...control on deep sea fishing.. maintaining proper balance of upwelling and down welling...reducing size of dams..."
A typical woke doc. of the DW. It's as woke as woke could be.
Yes. Go to clean energy. Germany must be seeing a lot of sun lately. Wonder how its windmills are doing. It will likely take 3 months and more to clear the debris and to rebuild. That puts the region right smack into winter. Interesting days are ahead
It’s so weird scientist !! All Global warming or everything changing made from scientists all over the world !!!!!
Global warming is a serious issue.  Great documentary.
"Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a crucial role in combating climate change by offering innovative solutions to regulate temperatures and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Here are some examples of AI solutions that can help regulate temperatures in relation to the issue of global warming:

Forecasting and management of renewable energies: AI can be used to predict the production of renewable energies such as solar and wind energy, which are inherently intermittent. By using machine learning models, forecasts can be improved, enabling better integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid. This helps balance the supply and demand of electricity, contributing to the regularization of energy consumption.

Optimization of energy consumption: AI can analyze energy consumption patterns in buildings, industries, and cities. By identifying energy inefficiencies, AI can recommend adjustments to reduce energy consumption, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity production.

Smart agriculture: AI can monitor and predict agricultural conditions, such as periods of drought or flooding. By identifying optimal times for planting, irrigating, or harvesting, farmers can better manage their crops to maintain yields while avoiding excessive water and resource use, helping regulate agricultural ecosystems and mitigate the impact of climate change.

Advanced climate modeling: AI can improve the accuracy of climate models by incorporating a larger amount of data and optimizing model parameters. More accurate climate models help better understand long-term climate trends and identify high-risk areas for adaptation measures.

Monitoring and prevention of natural disasters: AI can help monitor extreme weather events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods. By analyzing real-time data, AI can more accurately predict hurricane trajectories or estimate the potential damage caused by a natural disaster. This enables better preparedness, strengthens infrastructure resilience, and saves lives.

Intelligent transportation: AI can contribute to improving transport efficiency by optimizing routes, promoting public transportation, and facilitating the adoption of autonomous electric vehicles. More efficient mobility helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.

These examples demonstrate how the judicious use of artificial intelligence can contribute to regulating temperatures in the fight against climate change. However, it is essential to note that AI is not a singular solution to the problem of climate change but rather a powerful tool to combine with other efforts, such as adopting effective climate policies and engaging society in the transition to a sustainable economy."
Any updates on the parts of this documentary that were made four or five years ago?
"Imagine a healthy human. They do their respective work, then expect a fun vacation every year. Among those ""normals"" are people who look far into the future, beyond the profits of companies, who dare to ask, ""What is a normal healthy human?"" If the way we live is unsustainable, it will catch up with us, and we will have to redefine ""normal."""
"Not all heroes wear caps. Each action, no matter how small, contributes to positive change."

It's Averting not A   Verting
"As long as we keep adding more people exponentially, we will NEVER reduce emissions enough, like it said- we'd have to reduce current emissions bby a whopping 50% while at the SAME TIME the population will INCREASE by billions!
This is the results of 8 BILLION people on a finite sealed planet, and both India and China have been adding a lot more motor vehicles and air conditioners- they want both.
The USA in  1800 had just about 10-12 million people, only 10 years later- by 1900 had  75 million people, by just 50 years later that DOUBLED to 150 million, just 55 years later it doubled again to 300 million, now its 333 million and this kind of growth is UNSUSTAINABLE no matter what metric is used.

"I am afraid that all predictions climate scientists are making are wrong and that things are heating up way faster than even the most pessimist predictions. Svalbard is allready something like six degrees warmer than before, and over here in the Netherlands spring is allready over 2 degrees warmer than in the 1980's With the thawing of the permafrost under the boreal forests first vast amounts of methane will go into the atyhmosphere, and crazy amounts of carbon stored in the permafrost will be metabolised by funghi once the soil is thawed and drained."

"Of course back in the 19th century rivers & lakes use to freeze over in the winter & there were even makets held on the Thames & Matt Taylor of the BBC said it was caused by low sun activity for years but in the last 20 years there has been high activity by the sun, does any body not think that may have something to do with climate change? Of course there have also been over 2000 nuclear bomb test since the WW2 with over 500 emitted into the atmosphere. All of these things have made differences to the worlds climate & I sincerely believe that all that radiation has caused one in two people now getting cancer."

I will tell you what climate change is It is something  to say when politicians want to change the subject they do it all time
"Climate change is a term used by the governments to instill fear to weaker economies that rely on fossil fuel, after they realised that global warming is not working because the temperatures are actually dropping."
"Today is Feb 17, 2024. 
1. Why is the Earth getting warmer considered as a global issue?
Some people will be thinking I like hot weather. What's wrong with it?
Some parts of the word are already pretty hot. If you are in a particularly hot city and that suddenly gets a chunk hotter, that's going to make it a lot harder to live in that city. Beyond that, around the world, we have seen first-hand the effects of the world getting warmer. Climate change is turbocharging all sorts of extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, droughts, wildfires.
2. How do the climate change cause floods and?
That seems to be the opposite of what some people have thought would happen. Warm water takes up more spaces than cold water. And so, you get this thing called thermal expansion. Sea level rising is due to the amount of the warm water in the sea. Besides that, hot atmosphere causes ice sheets to melt, not just melt from the top down, but also to flow faster into the ocean. We 've already seen a huge increase in the rate of ice loss. Some parts of the word are also experiencing more drought as more water gets carried away from those areas,"
"People Power has the potential to:
Make cheap clean power anywhere,
Reduce most unemployment anywhere,
Eliminate poverty through stored energy sales  anywhere. 

First what is people power? 

Power out from a storm or disaster?
There's People Power, any low tech solution that would bring power to any stricken area where people are. Wind and water turn wheels to make power, but so can people. Yes it can be stored ahead of time. Yes it's portable.  Yes it's inexpensive. Yes it's good for the environment. Yes it's safe.
People Power, free power in any emergency, anywhere there are people. 

Next...
People Power not only could make energy in an emergency power outage,  but that type of low tech could also store energy for future use.  That stored energy could be kept for backup, used in that area, or transfered and sold somewhere else. 

We also know that there are places in the world where many people need work.  Why not combine the two. Out of work people could be hired to use their physical power to make energy. They would not need much training, and virtually any healthy adult could do it full time or part time.
Next the extra money generated, could be used to buy solar panels to augment their revenues. 

What we must insure is that these workers are paid a fair, honest wage, and treated well. This can never be forced labor. 

Sum up: This is clearly a win win for everyone: Healthy power, many new unskilled jobs, and the end of poverty anywhere in the world,  all in a new power industry."

It is time for all of us to prevent it with renewable energy sources!

"There is one question that is never addressed that would expose the ""climate crisis"" for the scam that it is, which is ""What percentage of the atmosphere is CO2?"" The answer, never given in plain language, is that CO2 is currently around 420 parts per million, (google it) increased, they tell us, from 280 ppm in 1850. That's a difference of 140 ppm, or in terms more readily understood by the layman, the composition of the atmosphere has changed by 0.014% (14 thousandths of 1%) in the last 170 years. LESS THAN 1 THOUSANDTH OF 1% PER DECADE! How much closer to ""zero"" do they think it's possible to get? How gullible do you have to be to believe that this rate of change is causing extreme weather events, which have always happened and always will? Their claim is that this tiny amount ""traps heat"". ALL gasses dissipate heat and even if CO2 is an exception, the suggestion that a total of 0.042% can overwhelm the capacity of the remaining 99.958% to dissipate that heat is abject nonsense. CO2 DOES NOT control the global temperature, there is no ""climate crisis"". Wind farms, solar panels, heat pumps, EV's.. None of these measures are necessary, nor will they have the slightest effect on the weather. Eye-watering sums of money have already been wasted on this futile exercise. Time to wake up, stop throwing our money at these boondoggles and squandering the world's resources on projects that cannot possibly succeed as there never was a problem to begin with. There is no need to save the planet from a minuscule increase in the gas on which all life depends, but it does need to be rescued from idiot politicians and media mouthpieces that push this garbage."
There is no such thing as climate change!
"Climate change refers to the long-term changes in weather patterns that are observed across different regions of the Earth. These changes are primarily driven by human activities that release large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere, leading to global warming. The effects of climate change include rising sea levels, melting glaciers and ice caps, more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires, as well as more frequent and severe storms and hurricanes. The scientific consensus is that human activities are the main cause of climate change, and urgent action is needed to mitigate its impacts and adapt to its consequences. activities that release large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere, leading to global warming.

i watched a report a couple of weeks ago about some small island trying to sue the mainland government about not doing anuf to stop global warming and how the rising sea levels would impact there way of life it turn out they cant sue as the government pointed out there's no actual evidence just computer predictions weather  and temp records don't go back far anuf to make real evaluations it is mostly fear mongering the evidence this year were i come from in the UK was supposed to be the hottest on record and they kept telling us that when we actually had 3 weeks of sun and the rest was overcast and rained at least 1s a week my wife is from California they too were meant to have record temps which never happened but were reported daily
"Climate change is not ""turbocharging weather events"".
The UN's IPCC AR6 report, chapter 11 'Weather and Climate Extreme Events in a Changing Climate' summarises the fact that severe weather events cannot be detected as increasing, nor attributed to human caused climate change:
Increased Flooding: not detected, no attribution.
Increased Meteorological Drought: not detected, no attribution.
Increased Hydrological Drought: not detected, no attribution.
Increased Tropical Cyclones: not detected, no attribution.
Increased Winter Storms: not detected, no attribution.
Increased Thunderstorms: not detected, no attribution.
Increased Hail: not detected, no attribution.
increased lightning: not detected, no attribution.
Increased Extreme Winds: not detected, no attribution.
There is no climate crisis. 
The UN's IPCC AR6 report, chapter 11 'Weather and Climate Extreme Events in a Changing Climate' summarises the fact that certain severe weather events cannot be detected as increasing, nor attributed to human caused climate change:
Pages 1761 - 1765, Table 11.A.2 Synthesis table summarising assessments
Heavy Precipitation: 24 out of 45 global regions low confidence in observed trend (12 medium confidence), 43 out 45 low confidence in human attribution. 
Agricultural Drought: 31 out of 45 global regions low confidence in observed trend 
(14 medium confidence. No high confidence assessment). 42 out 45 low confidence in human attribution (3 medium, no high confidence). 
Ecological Drought as above.
Hydrological Drought: 38 out of 45 global regions low confidence in observed trend. 
43 out 45 low confidence in human attribution (2 medium confidence, no high confidence).
So the IPCC are saying we didn't cause droughts and we didn't make it rain. How surprising! 
There is no objective observational evidence that we are living in a global climate crisis. 
The UN's IPCC AR6, chapter 12 ""Climate Change Information for Regional Impact and for Risk Assessment"", section 12.5.2, table 12.12 confirms there is a lack of evidence or no signal that the following have changed: 
Air Pollution Weather (temperature inversions), Aridity, 
Avalanche (snow), 
Average precipitation,  
Average Wind Speed, 
Coastal Flood, 
Agricultural drought, 
Hydrological drought, 
Erosion of Coastlines, 
Fire Weather (hot and windy), 
Flooding From Heavy Rain (pluvial floods),
Frost, 
Hail, 
Heavy Rain, 
Heavy Snowfall and Ice Storms, 
Landslides, 
Marine Heatwaves, 
Ocean Acidity, 
Radiation at the Earth’s Surface, 
River/Lake Floods, 
Sand and Dust Storms, 
Sea Level, 
Severe Wind Storms, 
Snow, Glacier, and Ice Sheets, 
Tropical Cyclones.
How about some quotes from the UN's IPCC AR6?
""There is low confidence in the emergence of heavy precipitation and pluvial and river flood frequency in observations, despite trends that have been found in a few regions."" 
""There is low confidence in the emergence of drought frequency in observations, for any type of drought, in all regions."" 
""Observed mean surface wind speed trends are present in many areas, but the emergence of these trends from the interannual natural variability and their attribution to human-induced climate change remains of low confidence due to various factors such as changes in the type and exposure of recording instruments, and their relation to climate change is not established. . . The same limitation also holds for wind extremes (severe storms, tropical cyclones, sand and dust storms).""
There is no objective observational evidence that we are living through a global climate crisis. None."
"Yeshua God is coming very soon. Are you ready?

- 예슈아커밍 / Yeshua Coming -

Please let people know.

Do you know this facts?

1. Clouds in the sky all over the world are gradually descending to the ground day by day.

2. The sun and moon in the sky are super sun and super moon every day.

3. If you look closely at sunrise and sunset, you can see a pink sky.

4. The chemical composition of chemtrail is being sprayed like crazy in the skies around the world.

5. If you observe the moon closely now, the moon is spinning round and round.

Unless you are a blind who cannot see, you can see the signs of the sky when you look up at the sky.

You should think about what this means.

Right now we see very little pink skies, the time is come we will see a very deep pink covering the sky all over the world. At that time, even the air turns purple.

You will see a planet floating in the sky that looks like a super-large DISK as if it were white. You will see that the sky is purple. You will see 24K gold colored light falling from the sky.

People will see big white planets floating in the sky here and there. People will see 2 suns floating here and there. People will see the supermassive red planet behind the sun at sunrise and sunset.

Nibiru is coming. Nibiru is one of a system. There are several planets inside Nibiru. A red planet, a white planet, a super-large red planet, a giant metallic-colored planet that looks like DISK, and other planets. God showed me the vision that Nibiru's position is now behind the sun.

Right now, wherever you are in the world, pick up your phone and take a picture of the sun. Nibiru and the planets behind the sun will be captured on your phone's camera.

You have to think about what all this means.

Be sure to read Matthew 24. Yeshua God is coming very soon.

Yeshua God is coming very soon. Are you ready?

When the sky becomes completely dark pink, it will the axis of the north and south poles is reversed. A great cataclysm is about to take place on this earth. That time was right before the coming of Yeshua.

Do you know who Yeshua is?

Yeshua is God.

John 3:16......

""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.

If you read the 24th chapter of Matthew, it is written all the signs that will happen when Yeshua comes again.

Matthew 24:29, 30......

""But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
""And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the SON OF MAN COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF THE SKY with power and great glory.

You must prepare true faith in Yeshua, true repentance, true love, and righteous acts.

You must prepare your soul, body, mind, and heart to be holy, clean, pure, strong, and bold, as light as air and clean as clear water.

Yeshua is coming very soon.

Only Yeshua!"

"Today is Feb 12, 2024. I watched the video talking about the climate change. During this time, I just passed three questions mentioned in the video. 
First question: What is the climate change?
Climate change is about the heat being added to the Earth system. Human activities like burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests that have been standing for hundreds of thousands of years create carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. The more greenhouse gas you have in the atmosphere, the more of the sun's heat get trapped in the atmosphere and the warmer the surface gets and that's why it's called greenhouse effect.
2. What are greenhouse gases?
Greenhouse gases exist naturally in the atmosphere. If there's no greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the world would be too cold for comfort. Greenhouse gases on their own are actually great. It helps to insulate the Earth. The problems we are facing now is the numerous of greenhouse gases being added to the Earth. 
3. What are fossil fuels?
All of the systems that underpin our lives. So how we produce food to eat, how we create energy to heat our homes, how we create electricity to power our devices, how we fuel our cars. For the most part, historically, we burn fossil fuels to produce energy. Fossil fuels are essentially from plants and animals from millions of years ago. We burn fossil fuels to create heat and electricity and everything. But then we also produce carbon dioxide as a side effect."
"Climate change is just a scare tactic to control the masses....All TOTAL B.S.....just like NET ZERO and all the other C*** put out by the media ....NOBODY CAN GIVE A REASONABLE EXPLANATION  AS TO WHAT ANY OF THIS MEANS.....YET PEOPLE SWALLOW ALL OF IT....Stay safe, stay free....."

"Rome's Portus grain port 200 AD at sea level, now up to 40 metres above sea level, is obviously not silted over, as NASA proclaims, attached, because it's visible on Google maps and satellite. Google maps indicate a current elevation about 40 metres above current sea levels. 


YouTube Drain the Oceans Rome pictures the evidence. It's the tip of the iceberg. There's a huge community of marine archeology studying sea levels fluctuations. Mostly below sea levels but some above. Apparently one researcher sought permission to scan the flood plains below Troy. 


Apparently there are hundreds of ports from the Roman era which are now above sea levels. Isle of Thanet, Shore Forts, Port of Rye UK. It appears the conventional explanation is ""SILTED OVER"" but new evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, is sea levels were higher in Roman times. Rebuilding global ports needs 100 years lead time ( check with Arcadis, Netherlands) and because we're talking about the End of Civilization, this issue is STAT.


Scientists who debated a physical environment without inspecting it are like Ancient Greek scientists who debated how many teeth a horse has without inspecting horses.


It's urgent that marine archeology, inSAR, NISAR, Adrok Scotland ( AI and big data radar points) and ground penetrating radar ( a new technology), geomatics ( a new science of ground instability or movement), mining tech, volcanology, ash layers, and so on re-examine the physical evidence because civilizations built on ports end when their ports are high and dry or submerged. Don't know whether sea levels will return to their (recent) peak in 10, 100 or 1,000 years, nor what the cyclical processes are."

"Check out Gregg Bradens videos on climate change, Gregg is a degreed geologist, and has studied thousands of ice core samples, he asserts quite clearly that climate change is a hoax and scam ( just another of the many )
He points out that the climate is exactly wher it should be and that he would be concerned if it was not,  he shows that the climate is cyclic in 100 years cycles, and asserts that our Great Mother Nature balances and regulates the atmosphere irrespective of what man puts out, Nature is and always has been more powerful than man."
Propaganda
One thing I notice about climate videos is they're too wonky and academic for regular people to take this issue seriously. It's always framed as either gloom and doom or a fun educational adventure. Nothing showing how an earth on fire will affect people's practical lives.
I just love this episode and  topic on which the whole vidoes are talked.. There is a still hope to control the adverse effects of climate changes.

"You can't win with the FAr Left BBC. They don't want fossil fuels (I'm surprised that they haven't disparaged them as 'dirty energy' ) but they don't want nuclear because the twelve year olds in charge at the FAr Left BBC have decided that nuclear is 'dangerous'. The same people in charge of the FAr Left BBC (the same kind of people, who, with their fanatical world view have been in charge of some of the most appalling events in human history) I'm sure would be vehemently against the damage to sea life from offshore wind farms and the damage to flora and fauna by onshore wind farms. That leaves solar; I live in the gloomy, cold and dark north of England. Thank you FAr Left BBC for keeping my house at 5 degrees centigrade all winter, seeing my poor budgie perish through cold and seeing me having to drive more often to the supermarket to get fresh food because my fridge isn't cold enough due to the power cuts enforced due to us relying on solar power all through the year.

"Genesis 1:28 - ”Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.”  FILL the earth, it says, NOT OVERPOPULATE the earth, but be WISE stewards of the resources over which God gave man dominion.  “Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”  Not commit extinction of every living species of creature other than man.  Rather maintain an ecological balance for the health and sustainability of all.  And this video should be mandatory for the Pope and the neo-fascist politicians as well."

"Cape Town almost running out of water, was not caused by a unique or new event. The area has for millenia often suffered from a few years of drought,  followed by an exceptional good rain season, after which things normalised.
The water crisis in Cape Town has been caused by a combination of neglect if maintenance and expansion of infrastructure by the National Government, run by the ANC, as wel as Mismanagement of the water stock in the reservoirs or dams feeding Cape Town, by the Wetern Cape Profincial Government and the Cape Town Municipal  Government, both run by the DA government. 
When the ANC took over government in 1994, SA had reserve electricity and construction of more dams were planned to provide for the shortages experienced in many parts of the country during drought periods. Since 1994, SA's population has doubled, mostly thanks to illegal immigration from all over Africa by people fleeing wars and dictatorships, looking for a brighter future and the ANC has frantically been connecting the ever increasing population to the existing electricity and water supply but has stopped maintenance on existing infrastructure and planned expansion there of was halted. No new dams were built and soon the power stations were not able to produce the amount of electricity they were supposed too, leading to large industries leaving SA and millions of people becoming unemployed. As water pipes were not replaced at the end of their life time, an ever growing percentage of water simply leaked out before it reached the consumers. Burst pipes in suburbs, causing thousands of kiloliters to run down streets into storm water drains, became the order of the day. Ofcourse the expanding population connecting to a declining supply would eventually lead to a crisis.

The DA which won local government and municipal elections in the Western Cape and in the City of Cape Town, is responsible to manage the reservoirs in the province and the City, but after the water crisis have already existing, not only they allowed more water to farmers than their quota while, citizens of Cape Town were constantly being scolded for not saving enough and the Mayor did house visits with TV cameras to shame alleged perpetrators, but sluices and valves of various dams were opened, letting valuable stored fresh water run out into the see. As day zero approached, and residents were allowed to spend no more than 4 minutes in the shower per day, using a bucket to catch whatever water they can to use in the toilet, the City dragged its feet negotiating over priced contracts to construct badly placed deselenation plants with capacity which would be a drop in a bucket of the demand. As citizens started uncovered all of this and were getting ready to que daily with buckets to collect water from tanker which were planned to transport water into the city, suddenly water was released from a reservoir up stream, owned by farmers who receiver good rain and shortly after, the drought ended with a La Nina event, filling all the dams within one season, just in time not only for Cape Town, but for many Cities and towns across South Africa which were approaching the same crisis.

So, don't be ridiculous and blame the climate. Water is a valuable commodity in SA and needs to be conserved, but we have always had droughts before and we will continue to have them. If infrastructure is not maintained and expanded in line with demand, you will eventually run dry. This time the rain came in time, but soon enough the next drought will come around. In the meantime, the population is growing, infrastructure is not expanded and the same people are in charge of managing the resources. Can someone see a disaster coming and does the climate have anything to do with it?"

"Dear BBC (Bloody British Broadcasting Corporation)
Do not recover from your imperial hangover yet. Now you have the same colonial frame of mind,
You were driven out 75 years ago by our independent leaders in India.
You have made a fake documentary of the Prime Minister of our country a few days ago (about the so called Gujarat Godhra case) because you have nothing left in the name of TRP, you people are beggars. In the video below, you started asking for money as beggars, what else can I tell you about your reality. No money for food and two correspondents were sent for investigation😂
There was a 22-year case against Narendra Modi, and all the congressmen started trying to arrest Modi, but what happened?
The Court of Session, the High Court and the largest Supreme Court of Justice had given clean cheat to Narendra Modi.
Such an institute which runs from the world's best constitution of India and which took this case for 22 years and gave time to each and every argument and proofs and got the investigation done but nothing came against Modi 

It's our statement, though.
But now I'm asking you, Beggars, to make 6 documentaries, and for this I'm going to give you money.
Make a documentary on this Issues 
1.) The story of Bloody Sunday, Ireland.
2) How many million people were murdered by Churchill?
3) Approximately 40 Lakh Indians died in the Bengal famine because the ECI hijacked all available food.
4) Thousands of people were killed in Jaliwala Bagh
5) Which 8-year-old Maharaj has given you the Priceless Kohinoor of India?

I know you don't have the stature to prove it.
You people have always been using the rule of divide and policy
You people are jealous that the India which was looted by your East India took away all the resources.
How did a country with 21% literacy become 80% today?

"This video gets the whole thing backwards. Every 58(?) years in northern India the bamboo flowers and fruits in that year the rat population goes from 6 rats per unit area to 1 million rats pua. Then when the fruit has all been eaten it's back to 6 rats pua It is the energy saved up and released by the bamboo that rats use to swell their population. If we graph human population over the last 10,000 years with a data point every 100 years, we get a graph with 97 data points less than a billion, one data point just over a billion, the next just over two and the last over 8 billion. Humans used the stored energy of the fossil fuels to swell our population. And now we stuck. Our food grows outside. If it's too hot and/or too dry the crops won't grow. And if our food is dead, we are dead. Death phase is coming for humans, and maybe extinction if we don't prepare for death phase."

"Well first of all quit allowing countries like China to keep producing crap that we don't need. We send production fo things to China, India and Bangladesh where they have low environmental standards and dump the waist into the water. It starts by holding the countries that produce the goods to the standards of the country these are being sold in. Then the cost would be just as high as in the countries that buy all the crap which in return would create jobs that are much needed and keep us out of getting to dependent on other countries to produce what we need which in the end gives them power.

"Climate change is about too many people using too much energy. I have a paper that just came out that discusses man's energy use and climate change. If one was to simply compare man's energy use to the Sun' radiation at the outer atmosphere (thermosphere), one would think no way. However, most of our Sun's infrared radiation is actually absorbed by the outer atmosphere thus explaining why the thermosphere is so bloody hot (this requires a new understanding of infrared spectrometry as discussed in paper).

 A gross misunderstanding of Stefan-Boltzmann equation has led to the thinking that visible light (70% of which passes thru the atmosphere) makes up 40% of our sun' radiation. This is based upon limiting our sun's output to the visible infrared, but our Sun's infrared extends to the microwave and this means only 7% of our sun's radiation makes it to Earth's surface as visible light. 

Anyhow if you made it to this point then please read my paper"" New thermodynamics: How Mankind's Use of Energy Influences Climate Change"" Hadronic journal 45(4) pg 399-421 (2022) or you can find it and some of my other papers at:

I liked the video because the documentary was well-done.  I don't like what is happening to this world because of unbridled capitalism and continued fossil-fuel reliance.  One cannot help but feel a great sense of sorrow for those of us humans stuck living and working in the hottest areas of the globe as each successive summer gets hotter.  Capitalism and greed is what changes human existence on this planet from balanced peaceful co-existence with nature to parasitical expoitation of this world destined towards another mass-extinction event.

"Don't you think it's slightly hypocritical of Dale Vince but everyone thinks he's great.. he used to be a hippy and live on the road as mentioned.. as he was driving about across the UK in a hippy van creating greenhouse gasses and polluting the air then he's like 'oh I'm all eco now "" ... Dude you weren't saying that when you pumping C02 in to the atmosphere for 10 years suddenly your eco because you started a green electricity company... It's like me owning a cow for 10 years then saying I'm eco now so I've killed the cow .. your a contributor to it...and you live on a boat which is diesel powered and diesel is another big pollutor for use to get to places if you need moor somewhere else and to run electric... You have to buy gas in gas bottles which means your polluting the earth taking them to and from to the place you got it let alone the company finding and making the gas ready for sale in bottles.. shipping those bottles from bottling plants to places.. yes you can take it back and have it refilled doesnt make you eco because they still had to produce it in the first place... Before you claim your eco check yourself before others check you...

"On shore wind farms now, solor on all new houses and factories....  if we had been doing this for the last 10 years."
He does supports Labour through a large donation and hasn't criticized their cut in spending for green projects. I would have hoped he challenged them more particulary as the cut came because of donation from a climate skeptic.
"What happens when it is dark and the wind isn't blowing? Use batteries i suppose.....but they aren't even slightly green....or ethical. Check out Siddarth Kara's book Cobalt Red for the sad truth about battery tech.

Sunak is a crook.. with a history going back to short selling RBOS when Brown was trying to save the bank. His family has received £1 billion from Shell in exchange for North Sea drilling rights.
this bloke has his head screwed on and talks a lot of truths
I'm so glad I am a Ecotricity customer...we need more people like Dale Vince.
What a brilliant guy Dale is.  His arguments are  blindingly obvious - so why does the current government not see it.
Great interview Ava👍
Rewild Britain including urban areas!... on Rishi Sunak: he's as corrupt as they come. He learnt it at the knee of his mentor Boris Johnson when Johnson was PM and Sunak was Chancellor.
crack pot
It hurts
Sunaks extended family has done a deal with Israel and BP for Gas and oil exploration in Gaza and of the coast of Palestine
Abit rich when labour want net-zero sooner which will destroy us.
Having worked in the powder coatings industry it is ver easy to change the colour of wind turbine. Some of the products I worked on were paints that look like wood which were common for buildings in cypress.
This guy seems to be out of tuch on  a few points i suspect he has a vaesed intrest in wind turbines. People have started to work out that so caled renuable enegy is not what we are being brainwashed to beleeve.   Nucaler power is by far the best option.

"It’s all to de-industrialise the west. And move all farmland and industry to low costs lands like China, India, Turkey etc. While they’re build coalplants rapidly over there. Don’t believe China’s propaganda by the CCP and they’re mega “switch to renewable’s.” Superprofits can be made in such countries where exploitation is normalized. All that we in the west are a so-called: “green, progressive, CO2 neutral, inclusive, diverse, jobcreating” or what ever net-zero insanity, empty worded, eco-socialist, neo-Marxist raped frame they shove it in these days! 😒 The climate change ideology is heavy politicized and wich itself is mainly created by big-business and governments.

I switched to Ecotricity a long time ago & I can happily recommend Dale Vince's company to anyone.
"@19:51 If only we had a party who's sole objective was to be green, what could we call them... ?"
They're ensuring the future. Green energy doesn't pump out the numbers the nation needs. Plus our contribution is almost negligible compared to total emissions.
Its because we signed investment treaties that enable gas corporations to use Investor state dispute settlements to sue the government and therefore the taxpayer.
it's far more difficult to profiteer off renewables than fossil fuels
Is he having a go at Russia China Poland bankrupting GB for something of less than 1% emissions.  He is a millionaire lining his own pocket.  I will resist EVs and the removal of boilers as long as I can.  He is hippy idiot
Turbines.... They're turbines...
"I may be wrong, but isn't the timeline: Sunak has meeting (without Minutes) with Shell executives at Downing Street, Sunak grants licences to permit gas/oil drilling, Sunak announces new gas-fired power stations? The power stations will take at least five years to develop and then we are subject to global fluctuations in fossil fuel prices and out goes net-zero. Meanwhile there are huge numbers of Planning Applications for battery storage (check it). Go for 'em Dale!"
"A 4kw domestic solar PV array with batteries, pays for itself within 5 years at current grid prices. After that it provides the home with 4000kwh a year for FREE for the next 20+ years.
Put another way that is 2p per kwh over 25 years.
But you won't see Rishi nor Dale pushing for that.
They want centralised energy with big energy companies making obscene profits - charging 30p for something that costs them 2p."
"Read the book Manifesto, It is an interesting story, and comes to good conclusions. Dale Vince is a man who puts his money where his mouth is. He was a lead in the 'Electric Highway' , a project that got Electric Vehicles onto the main roads, and was run at a financial loss for several years. 
Ecotricity has become my supplier of choice, a choice I have never regretted."

"What are we to do, vote.... for who? labour? 😂"
Sunak is probably getting a backhand or free shares so he can count his money more.
One statement within this entire interview should inform the entire UK population about how successful the Tory privatisation ideology has been! That is how much we pay for the fossil fuel that we harvest from our own North Sea oil and gas fields! The next crisis is going to be the availability of drinking water seeing as we skld that to foreign interests
"I totally agree with Dale. After the ridiculous announcement about gas power stations, I wrote to my (Conservative) MP saying exactly what Dale is saying here. The sooner the Tories are out of office, the better."
"I like Dale, but saying you’ve got faith Labour are going to do something they’re saying they’re not gonna do is bonkers. Align with the Green Party, fuck Labour and fuck the tories."
this could also be further complemented by generating power with sewage and being currently all water companies need to invest in sewage treatment it would be a great time to do this through HTC or biodigester processes or any of the variants.
The SNP will create the greatest Green economy in Europe.
"Alot people forget? Wasn't PM Ruiz Plan to have  net zero? Was Ex PM May . I don't believe in net zero, + a lot of people believe net zero is pointless . The future is hybrid technology, not just solar power.  Fossil fuel + renewable technology are both needed + ways of making Fossil fuel emissions net zero with hybrid technology.  Renewable energy can't replace fuel + gas would kill millions of people + stop economic growth around the world . Leadership around the world should leave the problem with the people + business . Get ideas 💡 from the people+ business.  Elon Musk has proven that solar energy has a place in the modern world but without society well-being + working standards + economic growth! Renewable energy is pointless. Information proves net zero is pointless + economical dangerous for every countrie + person on the earth 🌎."
"Excellent interview and nice to have someone who is genuine, sincere and cares about our future. Have been with Ecotricity for quite a few years now and see no reason whatsoever to change."
Is Dale's POV biased at all 🤔
"Im very happy with Ecotricity as an energy supplier. Im hoping their green gas schemes will get traction because I live in a new build house with a new boiler so it seems wasteful to rip it out to replace with a heat pump. Also, there is nowhere to put a heat pump in my house because its tiny."

"There is a genuine problem that we get week-long wind droughts during winter. To solve it we'd need about 6Twh if energy storage, so probably a lot more pumped hydro.

Otherwise we'll be trapped with gas back-up."
"Why does Dale keep saying ""windmills""? When was the last time a windmill was built?"
"This interview is awful. He makes all these claims, does not back it up even with his 30 decades worth and the woman asks him such dumb questions anyway. Forget the bloody politics and lets talk engineering. How are we going to do it and if you think it is wrong, how would you do it? Remember the wind does not blow all the time. What about the grid? What about storage? What about using thorium or SMR technology?"
"Great interview Dale. So much sense, well explained."
"I wouldn’t worry mate, he won’t be in power to implement them anyway. 😆"
I really appreciated this but I wish Just Stop Oil had been smarter.  Their protesting methods did more harm than good to the green cause IMO as people don't want to be likened to them & their movement has become a weapon to be wielded as a criticism by anyone that's not pro-green.

‘Big wind’ and ‘big solar’ are not green in any way…quite the opposite in fact.
"The issue of NIMBYism is a definition that is an actual thing relating to place-identity, it is important to take these issues into account when forming planning descisions. Developers will always have problems with so it is important that consensus building in local communities is part of the planning system which is something that does not exist at the present time. Personally I am not a fan of on-shore wind but the public do find it acceptable.

Disagree on Labour becoming green - labour has a poor track record on the environment this especially under the war mongerer TB who u-turned on all those public transport projects which we were promised in the mid-1990s."
Dale's a legend. Convoy style ✊
"I like Dale brilliant guy , the solution to the wind not blowing or sun not shining is so simple , it’s battery storage , feeding back at peak and slack times .
It exists now so why isn’t it being rolled out ? Maybe the fossil fuel industry spends billions convincing everyone that the green future (which doesn’t include them) is a bad thing."

"2nd Hand EVs are now relatively cheap so for 10k you could buy a car that will last 6 or 7 years.
You are saving (£50pw x 50 weeks) £2,500 a year in fuel so its costing you NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING."
I offered Dale the opportunity to create a carbon negative fuel 15 years ago. We could have made a real difference by now. He turned it down because he felt I was rushing him. I was going through a family break up at the time.
"What does this guy get out of this agenda? Maybe he as more fingers in the pie to make himself billions or millions, I don't know? He's not doing it for the greater good.. Mr nice eh.."
"He's wrong about the current state of the electric cars. Currently the cost to charge a car is deerer per mile than it is per mile in diesel or and efficient petrol. 

It's only cheaper if you home charge which isn't possible for most, especially those living in high rise buildings or terraced houses.

Electric cars also cost roughly a third more than their petrol equivalents and degrade must faster too. Both down to the batteries with them pushing up the price and how they degrade over time.

These issues need solving before more aggressively pushing people into those vehicles.
If the cost of energy is reduced, electric charge points are more heavily regulated and the battery problems are solved we can move to electric vehicles with no drawbacks."
"Dale is a well known figure locally and the stick that he gets is a combination of manufactured culture war mistruths, nimbyism and good old fashioned envy. I'm glad that he is gaining a wider national profile because he makes a valid evidence based case for renewables."
"It’s blatant corruption, that’s what it is!"

"You would not say that if you were in Eastern Australia where the El Nina El Nino effects cross back and forth across the Pacific variously giving the West coast of the USA or the East coast of Australia alternating Drought of Floods much the same elsewhere but when money or power come into play many so called scientists sell themselves out to the Marxist conspiracy cult of Man made climate change and the demonization of CO2.

CO2 at less than 0.04 percent of the atmosphere is essential for all plant life on Earth via the sunlight, Chlorophyll CO2 interaction of Photosynthesis by which all plant life on earth obtains the starches sugars and cellulose on which their life and growth depends.
A not so insignificant byproduct of Photosynthesis is Oxygen which every animal life form on earth including Humanity requires to survive, My take on this outright Fake man made climate change Bullshit is that compared to eons past where CO2 was a higher content percentage of the atmosphere we are in a time of dangerously low CO2 content in the atmosphere and these Marxist clowns want to lower it further, So the sixty four million dollar or should that be Deutschmarks question is just how much money does DW get from the German Government for making this propaganda I would bet they sure do someone in Germany who knows the system please investigate and reply or better yet make a youtube exposing these clowns"
"At grade school l did a science project on Australias Great artesian basin. Evidently this added to the other massive fresh water basins, that lay underneath the east coast of Australia meant we HAD enough drinking water to last the Nation for five hundred years. China came, bought the gas underneath it, so much that Australia had to buy some of our gas  back. You can find, just by identifying where all the current and intended coal seem gas infrastructure is (its all about 11 ml low grade iron pipe) where Australias fresh water reserves are. How long does cheap iron pipe full of petrochemical sludge last before ""just one"" oxidises or corrodes and the nations fresh water table becomes poisonous to all life forms? .. Tick tock tick tock.. And in a time when fresh water is so precious, how many Chinese funded gas pipes have been inserted through fresh water aquifers all around the globe, including throughout America. CREDOS to china for playing such a highly intelligent game.. Very smart! . They do not sink pipes through there own water table because they know the long term implications of doing such a thing is to horrible for their nations people to contemplate.."
"please understand that after 100 to 150 years, we will have sufficient technology and means to desalinate and transport water from oceans to anywhere on land through pipes All with using renewable energy. We may even not need pipes and be able to transport water by directing clouds and raining at desired areas and filling dams. Yes water will become a resource like gas, electricity but it will eventually become a very cheap resource by the time our fresh water reserves go low."
"Dumb. We have the ocean, remember?"
To answer the question. No. The world is not drying up. Saved you a bunch of time. You are welcome.
"Seems to me…
Most of the global problems would be easily solved if….
Humans just stopped making so many babies.  (More little human parasites making demands on the planet)
Although, this concept runs contrary for the profiteering rich share holders, and the corporations.

The world is not drying up.  There's plenty of water in the oceans and in the atmosphere.  The future is reverse osmosis desalination.
Yes it's drying up.  Probably going inside the Earth rather than the atmosphere.  That is probably what happened to Mars.
The water is not drying up what happens is that it is moving from place to place. Where is dry this year can be under water next year.

Hey
"In the United States, there has been an ongoing drought in the west for years.  Things are really drying out.  However, in the Great Lakes region, we have had record high levels in the Lakes. Two years ago, boat docks were completely submerged.  Remember, the Great Lakes of North America contain 20% of the Earth surface water.  They are veritable small oceans of clean sweet water.  Yes, that is true. I would like to make a couple of points.  First, the American west is over stressed.  The major river in the west, the Colorado, which is no great shakes compared to other larger American rivers is pretty much dried up by the time it reaches the Pacific Ocean.  That many people should not be living in the area.  These are bad policy decisions made by the government and citizens who have been propagandized to distain the American Midwest and live in an area not sustainable for the level of population. The second thing, I would say is that the climate around the Earth evens out.  While, the Great Lakes have high levels now, not that long ago they were at a very low level.  Which brings me to my final point, which is that the whole New Ice Age, Nuclear Winter, Global Warming, Climate Change, Climate Crisis (Opps that didn't play well so let's go back), Climate Change and ""in 12 years we will all be dead"" scare tactic is just not believable anymore to the general population.  People are not stupid.  More and more, Climate Change is viewed as something that happens naturally and in cycles like the rise and fall of the Great Lakes.  More importantly, in spite of continual propaganda like this video, people are viewing climate change as a way for the rich global elite to make major changes in society to enrich themselves even more.  Inefficient and expensive windmills and solar panels will nowhere near produce enough energy to replace fossil fuels which are becoming increasingly clean.  However, people are making a ton of money marring and yes polluting our beautiful landscape."

Allot Thanks  Documentary (DW )Channel For Sharing This Most Important Video &This most Important  Matter For Lives on Planet .Also this Environmental Enlightening Publishing with Labelling That Climate Change on the Planet Continuously Reducing Fresh Water which its only  Reserves in Earth  Poles & Frozen  Snows  On Tops of  Highly Mountains ....Maybe this Bad Ecology Phenomenon (Climate Change ) also Has Bad effectiveness on Global  Cold Winds Mobilizing  of Half North Earth   &  Global Hot Winds Mobilizes of Half South  of Earth   ...God Bless Scientific Efforts For Lives & Humanity interesting...on the Planet
"SEA RISE LEVELS.    THESE DRY AREAS. SHOULD BE THE SEAS WATER DISPLACEMENT TO CIRCUMVENT DILUTION IN SALINITY IN THE OCEAN THUS CREATING LESS DESTRUCTIVE WEATHER PATTERNS LIKE HURRICANES TORNADOS, HAIL, AND SEVERE SNOW STORMS!!!   SNOW. SAVE IT THAT COULD BE UTILIZED FOR FRESH WATER STORAGE AND LATER FILTERED. NOT UTILIZE DESALINATION!!"

"la commission européenne allemande avec le tribunal d'injustice
  L'UE au Luxembourg a déclaré la troisième guerre mondiale économique, recommençant avec la Pologne (comme en 1918, 1939) et en 2021. avant l'attaque de Poutine contre l'Ukraine. Qui a commencé les guerres mondiales 1 et 2 ? C'est comme ça maintenant, la troisième guerre mondiale a commencé. France - Macron, vous avez aussi un rôle à jouer - hochant la tête, tapotant l'Allemagne dans la guerre économique qui a commencé contre la Pologne, ainsi que dans l'armement de Poutine avec l'Allemagne. Macron - un hypocrite."
How come that other scientist is saying that because of climate change  the ice on the north pole is melting thus some low lying islands will drown sooner or later... while in the middle east they are having great floods... and we are facing water crisis???
Just wait for the next ice age.
The most important for us
electric lights is what plants crave.
Name me a 100 year period where weather was identical from day 1 to the final day 100 years later?
BABY KILLERS RACE IS BEING WIPED OFF THE MAP SICKOS
You can smell the BS here. !!!
God bless you...and thank you so much for your informative documentaries...more power to your program....
"In my opinion , all countries in the world should unitedly focus  for research on water generation using  chemical process  where the raw material chemical should be abundant recyclable or tapping Solar power  or any renewable energy. If thats done , that intellectual mind will  be worshipped as God forever humanity   exists . As im from India,  I believe river interlinking , aqueduct , sea water conversion may  bring fruit to marginal area and people with higher human cost , time and energy. Also we need to reduce  the  population in drought prone areas . But sadly when it comes to energy  countries in world play the game of cards,  if we truy admit the case of Nordstream 2 blocking to reduce  price and negotiate,  but I still believe if either European union or USA  or any developed nation find harnessing hydrogen fuel as prime mover of energy in furture ,  again they will be worshipped as GOD still humanity exists ."
"Water, woods, tree..."
"The real underlying problem with clean water access is inequality, or the need for capitalism to turn water into a profitable commodity. Until access to clean water is a universal human right with public or socialist ownership, there will continue to be a lack of planning to meet the needs of humanity. The privatization of clean water is a existential humanitarian crises which clearly exposes the problems of capitalism."
"Well you could consider moving to Atlantic Canada as we are spilling billions of gallons of clear fresh water everyday into the Atlantic Ocean! 

Also we (Atlantic Canada) and New England (USA) are increasing the salinity of the Atlantic every year with our excessive use of deicing salts per year which will destroy the Atlantic food fisheries that Europe (Iberia) lives on!"
Good afternoon! Thank you sincerely for the video! I hope to see new videos coming out soon :)
I think we’ll figure out how to properly filter salt water
"Damn lies!  All they need is desalination plants! The planet will never run out of water, and there is plenty just under the soil. Mankind is not draining anything. This is all deliberate, just like the tragedies of the Covid shots! Is it not suspicious that everywhere around the globe is drying up?? Research CERN, they have many around the world."
Bottom line Nuclear Contamination Whole water Cycle. This is why this program is Wrong. Fukushima Dinichi ELE
Desalination needs a revolution.
"Governments saying ""we need to fight global warming NOW"" has the same energy as ""Thoughts and Prayers"". Drastic (and necessary) changes won't be made until it's too late."
"I think even with rain water goes 99% into the ocean it's just nearly impossible to have 0% of ground water, because the land is always absorb sea water and filter it into ground water, perhaps some area which strongly depended on reservoir -from any sources might have deep impact but I digress"
Ya the ice caps are melting but the earth is drying up lol
Not true. H2O is going nowhere
When the New World Order psychos stop painting our skies with chemicals there will be plenty of fresh water.
"Years ago, when Singapore had the NEWater, ppl laughed and joked at how Singapore needed to recycle water run off from taps, some even call it pee water, which is untrue since it's not recycled from toilet (sewage) but from water from washing hands and vegetables from taps.. but now one day those countries who take water for granted may be soon learning they may need to recycle waste water in future.

Soon more countries will be like NASA recycling water used from showering, washing their cars for drinking.. using membrane"
But human should know that the world or the earth will definitely change and become extinct we human could just slow down this thing to happen but it will happen.
"Climate change has happened throughout history and in previous years temperatures have been higher with less civilization, it all swings in roundabouts"
Can we add that there are 6 billion people here on earth compare to 100 years ago. Just like oil is going to be use up.
No
Hello my dear friend! thank you for the cool video! keep filming! I'll wait for new videos
"What ‘s the point in finding fresh water in the sea, when all the water we need is on land. We just have to reduce wasting and we’re good."
There is SOOOOOO much water available. Unfortunately most of the population is only hearing the fear mongering and about the abundant solutions. Its easier to control an ignorant population with fear than hope.
😅🤣😂
Humans are horrible care takers of the planet unfortunately.
"Only one way out: STOP WASTING WATER. In the 1800s people did not have motorized pumps or taps. They had buckets to get water from the river or the pond or the well. It was hard work. They respected water. They did not waste water. In the 21st automated century we put NO work in getting water or growing food. So, now we do not have any respect for food or water. We just WASTE, WASTE, WASTE FOOD AND WATER."
"No not in my country, and I’ve studied Israel to. But yes the USA and Australia is consuming extreme amounts of water and will have to change their habitats. But I don’t see what the fuck the scientists are taking about? The rain that will not freeze on the Mountains will just run down, and their will be more rain in the futur, you can make water reservoirs in the mountains and make hydro electric plants , slowly letting the water out, will making electricity co2 free. And CO2 makes plants need less water, grow faster and bigger, if you don’t know."
Negativity and pessimism rules these days. These changes may actually be beneficial and positive.
Save Our Planet
Our earth is a renewable resource we will never run out of water this is all a lie from Satan himself.
The more trees in areas the less water flows
"With this concern about climate change for most of you that have only been on this planet since the internet came out.
The world doesn't have a problem with climate change it will be here long after we have gone.
These people are the same people that said we were heading for the next ice age in the 70s.
Next the sea was going to rise and flood all the islands you can go on and on about it, but this will not change the world.
The world will do what it likes regardless of what we have to say about it. 
All I can say is do your bit clean your area and stop mooning about how bad your life is and get on with it.
You're not here for long time, by the time they put your graveyard boots on, and you turn to dust no one care what you did."
Good to have ice stored up.
What happened in 1970 that caused everyone's well to go dry in central KY??

I love water no one I'm just world can live without water water is the precious thing on this world gift from God 🙏💯🍽💧💧💧💧💧💧🌊
After few years nile river also dry up i swear  ✋

"Yes, because we have forsaken the commands of Yahovah and do not honor His son Yeshua. Repent while we still have water 💦"
The only way the earth could dry up is if the water started evaporating into space like it did on Mars. The earth has every drop of water that's ever been here except for what's gone into space on space crafts. The water will move around places that are wet now could dry up and places that are dry now will get the water. We need desalination technology to advance to give us the ability to turn the oceans into drinking water.
"Is the world drying up? yes. paradoxically, more moisture is held in the air. but water coming down will be far more intense, flooding, and rivers and dams will no longer behave as intended 50-100 years ago when designed and built with channels and dams. But those Exxon executives sure got nice bonuses, along with their propaganda (lawyer), divisions, didn't they?"
Every single person is dead by 2040 from climate change & biodiversity loss.
Thanks for providing informative video ❤
"not due to climate change, but due to ever growing virus called humans"
Nicd
More environmental propaganda
great
"Population isn't the main problem.
The problem is ruling class & education"
In the Australian outback at the moment water is reaching the surface and forming small lakes in places water was not found in the past. What explains that?
Civilization is fcking up the planet. We need to go back to living like our ancestors did
You can't resist change😂 let it go .... we are only passing by this 🌎 😂
What nonsense.
"Climate change is so real  and it's happening right now as I speak , it is an urgent threat facing our entire species and we all need to work on it , together , and ""Stop Procrastinating ...."".    NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE WRATH OF MOTHER NATURE , WE TAKE CARE OF HER , SHE TAKES CARE OF US , IS THAT TOO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND ???"" ...."
"Please stop with this crap, these things have always happened in cycles it’s how it works. Don’t be simple😂"
YOU EXIST BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE..its THE driver of evolution and NORMAL
"Ok if we are now stop using oil the air will be clean 💯 then what's going to happen next? Earthquake, tsunami on and on we can not fight the nature but we are standing still as nature do it work.
Remember nature created human and that will never change"
"Climate change will not seek Artificial nation-state borders, our Earth belongs to all of Us and the driving socio-political system is failing humanity here. Capitalism is no longer serving the growth and development rather it is now destroying everything."
Love You All Sir Ji and All Mam❤️❤️❤️.(Nice Documentary❤️❤️❤️).(if not now when then?) (Please save the Earth🙏🙏🙏) (कृपया पृथ्वी को बचाएं🙏🙏🙏).
Yes moving is the most logical option since fighting the ocean sounds ridiculous not to mention impossible
"My climate change predictions from my point of view
i look at all movements and patterns of where they are heading for climate its not looking good at all it looks extremely bad within less then 100 years so most of you reading this will live to experiance this EARTH WILL BECOME MARS 
Earth will over heat to point you lose water, wild life extinction big animals i predict dying first sort of how in past extinctions bigger died earlier smaller had advantages.
i think a increased demand to get off earth will cause us to return to moon and reach mars. We will recreate mars buildings on earth. Nature will die, billions of humans will die most of people you know you will watch die in front of you, im sensing a increased struggle to breath will feel like your choking to death.
You will be restricted down to suits and small buildings near each other only life remaining inside huge cities.
LOOK at Canada, USA, new york, california pattern is most of life already inside big cities those living in bigger feild already are dying faster its often republicans who deny climate change continue living in dying areas of earth while democrats moving to cities so world is becoming more democratic, more climate change activist, more vegan, more naturist, less religious these views are not only increasing because their cool but because climate change is killing the climate deniers. So if we do become more clothes optional problem is it will be inside big cities like Minneapolis, New york!!
Give us 10 more years i bet GOP will never regain a presidental election again
BUT i dont think all humans will die just a very huge billions people will die in a post destroyed earth but also multi planetary society no longer forcing clothes for sexual reasoning but now its your going to die reasons but likely allow nudity inside safe cities"
"Weird how every woman in climate change videos has a shaved head or short hair, like a male or boy hair cut"
New Technology to Combat climate change
Smart people ignore or don't recognize the effect of Hudsons Bay and Davis Straight when they are frozen or open water in winter. The effect is dramatic and works on a multi decade cycle.
Man made changes are fantasy.. The sun and magnetic field is changing and it's natural cycles of Earth Catastrophe
To this day there is no link to CO2 and temperature change all data shows from core samples of past event that showed high CO2 levels there where no temperature variations this is the basis for the hoax.
Stop spraying the sky. Check and search weather modification.  This is all manufactured and would not be happening if people would stop messing with the weather
"Personally I think we have been living in a sort of perfect weather ""grace"" period for the past 10,000 years and it's been great perfect for our transition into farming etc. And I just think we are starting to see the next cycle, of course humans have pumped countless tonnes of pollution into the atmosphere but so did the recent Tongan volcanic eruption (the largest on record I believe) yet no one seemed to bat an eyelid at how much stuff - chemicals, gases, physical particles - was expelled into the layers of atmosphere? Why is no one adding events like this into the equations??"

"The country that blew up the Nord stream 2 pipeline caused a major blow to the global warming. The damage is equal to annual carbon footprint of a whole country.
And please be fair, reasonable and honest don't point your fingers at some adversary  just because it is politically more convenient to you."
That pipeline explosion ?? Didn't help But oh well . Right !
"Please note the following caveat placed on many websites, Twitter, Wikipedia, YouTube etc:
Climate change United Nations:
“Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels.”

This is at best bias, propaganda, exaggeration or based on deliberate social engineering. Sadly it is based on computer models designed to produce the desired result for those commissioning the prediction.
In reality the statement would seem to be a lie.
May I suggest YOU read the full IPCC Report, which fails to support the claim! May I remind you that for centuries the consensus of scientists were claimed to believe the Earth was flat
& the consensus of scientists & the whole of the Catholic Church agreed the Sun, planets & stars all revolved around our planet!
 
Before the 1970s The Scientific consensus, as shown by advertising at the time, agreed that smoking tobacco was good for you!
Real science has never been reliable and has always depended on debate, new information & proof!
Remember around 80% of electricity we use is generated by Oil, Gas & other, so called Fossil Fuels & there is no scientific proof that CO2 causes Climate Change OR Global Warming!
Clearly, as Oil & Gas are mainly extracted from between 30 & 35,000ft below ground around the planet and science shows there is zero fossil activity below 16,000 ft. below the surface neither Oil nor Gas are Fossil Fuels!

Our planet has had a changing climate, with periods of warming, cooling & ice ages for 4.6BILLION years."
"It's a year later, temperature records were broken everywhere and everyone is still turning a blind eye to the problem"
"Greed will end people , people said loosely . Putting it off decade after decade , useless governments on and on .   Air travel even during international pandemics . Cockroaches will replace the shallow contemporary greed that controls all the power . Global misery . Thanks greedy politicians . The hungry will be coming for YOUR food ."
Nature is angry on civilization because of human activity and burning of fossil fuels.
Try a artificial Cooling core system dinosaur and heater belt your going to need fuels this is the 3 drop off 4 before it's dead along with you!.
"It doesn't help that the forest at the beginning is a man made monoculture forest. Pests and diseases increase in a monoculture that specialise in attacking a species in a monoculture. I know a troll will tell me I'm wrong, but I have a degree in horticulture and worked in an arboretum surrounded by a monoculture factory forest."
"Climate does change but not as radical.. better tell China, US and India to reduce their carbon emission since they contribute more than half of the worlds carbon pollutants"
I live in Australia and due to all the trees being removed and climate change the wind is insane. It is so windy where I live they won't build wind turbines
"This documentary seems thorough,but falls short of the manmade influence on weather warfare .As in the comments ,the lack of open minded undressing of how climate change can be mitigated.Pkantvmire trees, & greenery . Mike was on point , regarding the harsh effects of C02 ,hype ,on humankind.Agreed we need to be more creative towards the solutions, and not just the dogmatic statements of the drumbeating CO2 emission pirates. No one mentioned HARRP ,and various other systems by other countries that alter the jetstream & storm directions."
What a load of fraudulent bollocks for the mentally challenged
And yet germany is going back to burning coal and wood. Hypocrisy at its best!
"BULLSHIT. Stop working for the United Nations, WEF, WHO you sound bought and paid for. I have SCIENTIST THAT SAY YOUR LYING. And the world has LEARNED AFTER THE C that the SCIENCE IS BULLSHIT."

Yep we have never seen a storm as bad as Ian before...
ISAIAH 55:12
Ya notice how climate change is all about the last 20 years or so . I like the 5 ice ages we've had followed by the 5 Warming trends weve had and currently living in a warm trend now . Follow the real science.  Climate change panic is big business and big dollars .
"Le Chatelier's principle states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium shifts to counteract the change to reestablish an equilibrium. If a chemical reaction is at equilibrium and experiences a change in pressure, temperature, or concentration of products or reactants, the equilibrium shifts in the opposite direction to offset the change. In short, earth will rebalance to reduce the effects affecting it. 👍"

More bullshit. The greatest amount of greenhouse gases comes from the animal industry. 650 gallons of water to make 1 gallon of milk. Deforestation loss of ground water greenhouse gases. Quit eating meat and dairy. People are completely stupid.
Human extinction on its way! but what tragedy we are taking the other species with us.
"the climate change is a hoax and by now almost everybody know it 
so stop trying this proven false narrative it  is not working anymore"
"Overall, an extraordinarily direct, logical, and convincing doc on Earth's (and our) next ten thousand years. (On a different note: a personal Thank You for the lack of background music; subject matter is itself sufficiently dramatic.)"
Need a lot of wind and wave energy to slow it down
"Adding sand to the beach .......stupid, stupid, stupid......................"
"All this is a lie, do not believe a word ."
"All the sycophantic bubbling praises of this non-issue. I wonder how many of the commentators are bots. Climate changes has been happening since the creation of planet Earth. Nothing new, just fluctuating."
If we immediately don't stop Chemtrails and H.A.A.R.P it will be worse. If you still believe there is Climate change instead Weather Manipulation weapon...you are going to see further victims and weatherkatastrophies.
Winds will change when you put up windmill farms pushing earths natural wind flow into opposite directions!
Marxists
One trip in an aircraft from London to New York produces the same amount of pollution that a car does over 40 years. Perspective works wonders on the shallow mind.
"yes, but no. 
climate change is the result of our sick state of mind and emotions fueled by envy, greed and the belief we are so understanding and intelligent that all these solutions somehow will work so as to keep feeding into the present economic destructive system oh, yes if a nation has a different one..may the westerners impose themselves so we all-together-comity suicide..together"
This is a cycle it will reset itself like it always has over the centuries
"Scientistswarningfilm...check it out. Its 25,000 Scientists calling the alarm on climate change..it's  true and it's  here."
Let's blow all the pipelines...
So the wind is a living entity
climate change misinformation
"There had been always changes in our history.
It's part of existing"
"Well, if we human can change any time and day I see nothing wrong with wind change  it's patterns too.🙄"
"Coastal erosion is a normal situation, if you built close enough to the coast expect the natural results, jetstream is a natural phenomenon varying in strength and location depending on the energy in the atmosphere which depends on solar radiation reaching the earth, air traffic, volcanic eruption causes variations in water vapour in the stratosphere, the variables are numerous therfore over the longer term tiny/large variation is beyond the influence of the cycle of human kind."
Who creates that wind
I think there is some warming but I hate they always act like it’s humans most likely we are still just going thru a natural warming period just like we had many cooling and warming periods in the history of the planet also I hate that they always talk about the doom and gloom there is also many good things with warming like more tropical forest and tropical life and more areas able to grow crops to feed humans.
What's next
"Blue context links on these narrative pushing videos sure as heck makes them easy to spot. Very telling indeed. Brilliant idea. Thanks.
 Say, you guys ever go on Pokerstars?"
"This so called climate change is nothing new to the planet. It happens every 25,000 years. Garbage pollution on the other hand is the fault of humanity. 100% fact."
BS propaganda.
we still keep on with this drama without even the slightest of any kind of ugh !!
"The end of the YOUNGER DRYAS cold period that began 12800 years ago then abruptly stopped with the beginning of the Holocene Epoch some 11,600 years ago. The Last Glacial Maximum was close to the end of the PLEISTOCENE EPOCH 25,000 years ago when Canada and Northern US was under a 1-2 mile thick sheet of ice."
Clowncracy is climate change
The graphics showing the northern wind systems is wrong.  The N Trade winds blow from the northeast not from the west !
Solar wins and the SUN affects OUR earth’s climate and we’re heading into a cluster Ffffffff for at least the next 4 hundred years and global COOLING is what’s coming NOT warming
"This is the worst lie in the 21st century, hang your heads in shame!"
...        AND THE US IS PAYING 🇮🇱 THE HOLOCOUST.
climate chaange and climate crisis is a globalist economic and cultural  offensive on humanity.
"Propaganda!!! There's no such thing. Look at the hurricane charts and in the last hundred years there's been less an they've been weaker, this is complete crap. The earth changes hence the ice ages, this is more fear porn"
"We have to remember that man made climate change is a theory, not a fact. Weather has always been extreme."
"This starts to sound so complacent because the ionosphere heaters  and chemtrails ( solar radiation management) are never mentioned...The devil runs this world  hence the way things been ran.  They call indigenous peoples savage,  yet nothing killed the environment like so called civilization.... were doom and we will al die sick af"
"The federal government must joint efferts with state and provite interprise to make an infrastructure and afortable housing for the people with low income that withstand the tornatos, flouds , hurecans, and snow, for all those states where these happen every year , and that with the climate change they come much stronger and more often."
Weather control isn't good for nobody
There is no global warming there are no more extreme weather events than there was 20 years ago
We the world burns 100 million barrel of oil per day…
Biggest scam in owner life time
It's great that YouTube now pins these blue context links to every one of their misinformation spreading propaganda videos now. Sure as heck makes the BS  easy to decipher now. Brilliant idea. Thanks.
Bull Crap
"To watch that farmer make such wise and deliberate choices to adapt his field to the present climate is wonderful. It would be grand if his ideas could be shared throughout all farming communities. Then others could use what would be applicable in their scenario. Hopefully, this will be done. As for tree planting, there can never be enough of that. May many volunteer to help.  Thank you."
...
As mudanças climáticas (ventos.... derretimento do permafrost.... temperaturas extremas)estão quase que invisíveis para a maioria das pessoas elas nem percebem a catástrofe que se aproxima.... quando as consequências chegarem será tarde demais para todos nós.......
dont know what storm surge .two minutes is enough of this crap. fear mongering fake news con.
"As mudanças climáticas acontecem e acontecerão sempre, mas o fato dos humanos ocuparem e registrarem imagens e documentários sobre o assunto, alarma se as pessoas. Bastava construções seguras e menos aglomeração de pessoas que os efeitos seriam menores e menos alarmantes."
I find the fact that those particular winds at about ten thousand feet are just about the same height as thousands of large aircraft are criss crossing the  skies 24 hours a day  ???
The 1% is still too damn greedy. Divert resources. Make Billionaires illegal. There is such a thing as single entities having too much money
"Why do they sell climate change? Because it scares you, and in fear you pay."
This mainly discusses the effects of climate change and how we could adapt. We should be discussing the cause of climate change and how we can all reduce it. Meat consumption -> deforestation & Methane/Nitrogen Oxide release -> melting ice caps -> global warming.
"I guess we can start farming in Alaska, Siberia… The richest soils on the planet."
"The real fact is the milankovitch cycles that have always existed.   The climate is going to change and there's nothing we're going to do to stop it.  

What we NEED to do is prepare for a massive change, because it's coming... like it or not.  
Just like hide and seek 😅"
It’s collecting responsibility presented the world ❤
"The majority of the carbon footprint from tourists comes from flying to these faraway places, so, even if these tourist destinations were ""green"", it would affect the overall carbon footprint little.  We really need to add a carbon tax to fossil fuel travel and make that tax progressively ramp up the more a person travels.  I don't agree with the hotel manager that he shouldn't burden guests from sustainability.  Guests, good ones, would even score a hotel higher for being environmentally conscious."
*MORONS*
In my country the big cruse ships are the worst.
"Just watched the apple event. It's the same in Big Tech. Companies, consumers going on about how green they are whilst using up more and more resources.

Fast Travel, Fast Tech, Fast fashion. Destroying the planet."
Climates been changing since the BIG BANG and guess tourism been around not long after that and still here today.😊
"Respectfully towards the people talking in this documentary, one has to point out that global mass tourism itself is one of the factors of climate change. So flying to Mallorca, moreover: building new airports to Greenland and cruising around the melting ice with diesel boats will keep emission rates high and lead to collapse at a certain point."
Yea. New airport is coming. More emissions ensured. Gg.
"The 1st world lifestyle isn't sustainable. We all need to live like the 3rd world, right?"
"More excellence from DW. I'm in ""Silicon Valley"" which like the rest of the US has a very large ""internal third world"" with a then veneer of wealth. I make less than $20k a year, get around by bicycle, do my own cooking etc., in other words, while not perfect I think I do a fairly good job of being ""ecological"" and I still feel bad about the fact that I will take one final plane flight back to where I grew up because it is my home and I want my last years to be spent in my actual home. I've even looked up perhaps taking a cruise and ""jumping ship"" when it touches on my home port (less ecological than flying on a plane) or hitching a ride on a cargo ship (that's not really a thing any more) even buying a sailboat and sailing on my own back home isn't as ""green"" so there I'll be, hopping on a plane. 

I think tourism is a great idea but now with the internet it's possible to see so much of the world anyway, people can set up cams etc., plus, why not work on making your own area better? I know once I'm back home I plan to take part in what ""ecological"" activities I can and to do things to improve the place."
"Don3t travel for fun, don't drive cars or worse disel trucks & don't have any children."
tourism at this time on earth is immoral
If 1 million locals for 365 days = 16 million tourists for X days. X = ? 🙃
"And I’ll probably be banned for this, but anthropogenic “climate change” is a total fiction. It’s a lie designed to force people who don’t already have a lot to never climb the ladder high enough to get it."
"You might get the hotel replaced to carbon neutrality, but there's nothing carbon neutral about the tourists that turn up."
😂😂😂 you guys are crying about climate change here and on the other hand giving arms to ukraine and fuelling the fire of war between Ukraine and russia . Whole world is suffering due to that.
That old german dude in the Palma hotel...
climate change = digitalized new world order
climate change like seasons in a year 🤣
"dont do it greenland - lesrn from lessons elsewhere. No mentioned made about the huge carbon footprint from planes and worst cruiseships, Money profit and more disasters for the world to come. whst has to happen for people to wake up, how often have we heard the words now ""human activity responsible for climate change"" and yet we continue living the same way....."
Should be eco-guilt for sure
The best solution is the employer and government pay to stay home. The tax payers tax will be recycled in the homeland and no overtourism.

"When you destroy other countries by bombing them and killing innocent people, you will see more disasters coming up . Hypocrite"
I wish travel was more expensive.   Im tired of seeing poor people
"Mallorca... 16 million tourists? How about this, 10e fee for water when they arrive  1m^3 of water desalination  costs 1.2e to produce. From some search I did, this means 10e would provide 8300 liters of water desalination.  Or even on steeper prices at least 3000l.

Andratx and Alcúdia plants could grow with 160m euros to desalinate more. Thus filling their irigations and their reserves.

I call b.s on any place with huge tourism"
🤡🤡🤡
I wonder if the german eco tourists and operators support closing the nuclear power plants then having those EV charging stations powered by burning coal and gas
Is there a place for tourism in times of climate change? 🤔😉
What about traveling less? Aren't we all thinking that maybe the answer lies in the reduction of tourism?
Really want to visit Greenland at somepoint
Unspoiled nature is gonna get spoiled real quick. Just leave these places in peace. Seriously
"Flood disaster, glacier melt and mass tourism 🤔 found separately on a First World Continent. Here you found them together in one country 🇵🇪😌🤭"
The biggest factor for climate change is the INDUSTRIALIZATION in human society [tourism or eco tourism is no different]. Money making habits is the biggest reason. Start living as tribe. That is the only solution.
Can someone please help me understand why anyone would wish to see an environment  that is being destroyed  and will soon be gone ?😢
Eco tourism stay home.
"I haven’t even watched it yet, and I can answer the question. it’s arrogant, conceited, socialist, EU oriented, Eco guilt. And it’s also atheistic. You are not in control of this planet, and its name is not Gaia. The god (I’ll be magnanimous… of whatever religion other than Gaia in which you believe) is in charge of this planet."
"First World Problems. At least you all have a buffer. Third world had far less to start with. Colonialism, western pillaging, etc saw to that."
We are awful.
"Or colonial consummerist marketing, demoralization, into appathy and/or hatred, thus far and enabling ecocide, specicide, and gencide, by deforestation and agriculture?"
.. and now it is Greenland’s turn to be destroyed..
"How can building 2 or 3 new airports be a way of dealing with climate change? Eco tourism, ha ha, not funny, but surely not serious either."

Bless you.
"Tourism, like any other industry, is primarily driven by profitability, often overlooking the environmental and social costs borne by local communities. To ensure sustainable tourism and achieve net-zero impact, we must implement a robust framework of checks and balances, as well as standard operating procedures (SOPs). These measures will guide and compel everyone involved in tourism to act responsibly, safeguarding both the environment and the well-being of the communities they impact."

Taking a flight is the worst thing a person can do cause climate change.
"Watching this video made me think that we need to consider something a little more fundamental. If the natural environment in which we live changes, all of our lives will inevitably change. It is natural that even our survival is threatened.

""You cannot be dreaming now of happiness and all the wonderful things you are going to be, do and have. You have to respond to the changing landscape. When your environment changes, everything changes. When your climate changes, everything changes. When your resources are depleted, everything changes. Those who can see this and face this will find ways to prepare in a constructive way, not simply to fortify themselves, but to put themselves in a position where they can be stable enough to be of service to others."" ~ Marshall Vian Summers"
"Climate is always changing human society think they can control everything even the planet poor souls.
Co2 is life"
"It's surreal to think that climate change will give a pass to tourists ""who deserve to switch off their minds and not think about climate problems"". There is no such liberty anymore. You go to these high-end hotels, you contribute to the issue. Unfortunately, the cost of those contributions are never seen or felt by those people, but instead by the local population."
100% plant based menu will line up with the climate friendly goals
"Propaganda. Floods and droughts have always existed, now the media screams every time one happens and overlooks perfectly fine weather and growing seasons everywhere else. I also notice Ursula Von Der Lehn hasn't missed a beat with her private jet."
Climate change 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 shut up already
Global warming is creating great opportunities for urban kayaking.
One of the top 20 producers of pollution is international air travel .. it's more than many countries.  Think about that before you go on vacation  internationally
Tourists asking about and expecting eco sustainability ?  Please ..
“Eco tourism” = ask visitors not to use certain sun screen meanwhile keep building more and more accommodations
Hotels need to get over not wanting to limit water use.
Thank DW for another great documentary ❤
08:34 the irony of water shortages caused by environmental issues while shooting drone footage with every house with a swimming pool in a place 5 minutes from the beach.
"Dw with is usual biased bs, nothing new."
"Southern Europe operate tourism for six to seven months, not the whole year. That's the normal practice."
Can't wait for the future when instead of Miami and Ibiza people are flocking to Alaska and Iceland
Fucking YOUTUBE Throttling!
There are many ways to maximize efficiency of water use if there is money available. Water use should not be a barrier to growth. People need jobs after all.
"Greenland had better be careful on what the are wishing for. Mass tourism will destroy the local area. Where to put the increased waste, human and industrial. Humongous cruise ships add nothing to the local economy but leave an environmental scar once departed. No meaningful jobs are created."

"May the Anthropocene (Pyrocene (?)) epoch make the Permian-Triassic extinction event seem like a minor footnote in the pages of Earths history. Hopefully, scenario SSP5-8.5 of the IPCC assessment comes to fruition and ends the Anthropcene. Enjoy what you can, while you can and pity the next 3 to 5 generations to come."
Another great documentary by DW regarding climate change.Keep it up 👍.
Wait til they find out about bali
"When 2 years is not enough for restoration, then the next climate extreme may end the whole business.

Ie. In California there have been places where houses has been burned down 3 times in a row and no insurances are given. Similar situation is in parts of Florida, where ""sunny day"" floods have ruined entire city blocks and people has no money to move out, because none will buy their house.

It is also similiar to coral bleeching events. One harms the reef, next takes out plenty and third one says there is no reef.

There is very little to do with these events. You may still relocate yourself, but when that happens to billions, then all available locations are already taken."
🔥🔥🔥
Talk to corrupt people nikal beta..
First tourism then colonizers due to climate change eventually they will want to stay…. Not a good idea to allow that in a developing country.
"""There are huge non climate effects of carbon dioxide which are overwhelmingly favorable which are not taken into account. To me that's the main issue that the earth is actually growing greener. This has been actually measured from satellites the whole earth is growing greener as a result of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. So it's increasing agricultural yields, it's increasing the forests, it's increasing all kinds of growth in the biological world and that's more important and more certain than the effects on climate."" ~Freeman Dyson, Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey."

Interesting because I live in a hot climate and it’s much much cooler and more comfortable. I’m so happy finally I used to dread the 5 month summers.
Zero proof of concept climate analysis to discover a consensus long form data that provides a complete conclusion climate change is based on human interaction. This video provides nothing actually related to climate change.
10:35 The Netherlands looks super weird without its lakes
"We all want to explore beautiful places in the world. So, tourism can't be stopped completely. We need to come up with practical solutions to attain sustainable tourism. There needs to be strict laws for tourists regarding use of resources, be it water, energy etc. Hotels can't say,""we don't want to disappoint customers"" and then let people use limitless water, etc. After all, it's a matter of the survival of us as a species.
We need to move beyond a purely capitalistic mindset. 

May we find the way out towards survival and attain ultimate peace and prosperity as a species."
Ecotourism doesn’t exist. Climate friendly travel is a contradiction.
"Climate friendly tourism?!?!? Not one mention of air travel and the CO2 emissions that creates. The solution for now, is for people to travel less if they care about the planet, its climate, current and future generations."
WHY YOU GUYS ARE SO GOOD AT PUTTING STUFF TOGETHER IN DOCUMIES?
"Buy Local if possible. Don't fly if possible. Eat less meat. Drive less if possible. Waste less. Everyone can help, but until governments stop thinking that unlimited growth is the answer, we are in trouble. And making people upgrade everything in their home and their mobility in the interests of ecology (read money) is an absurdity. Throw the old working items away and buy replacements from China."
What a load of bull. Everybody knows cyclists and walkers spend zero money locally compared to the real only attraction in the region. The nurburgring.
"After advancing so much that even average working people in developed countries can travel the world to some degree, we’re heading back into times in which only super rich can afford it. Oh irony…"
The end approaches but the apocalypse is long lived
So they are greenwashing their hotel
Thank you. Very informative
*Next business model - book a vacation to countries most affected by climate change 🤦🏽‍♀️🤡🤪*
Travel with airplanes and enjoy your life while we still can.
I'd love to visit Europe but not if there's already a huge mass of idiots already there messing everything up and eating through resources making everything in Europe cost more. You can only trust some of us Americans to be respectful and responsible. Sadly more and more Americans are just too selfish and too megalomaniacal to care and they're probably the only ones who can afford a trip to Europe. I can only imagine them going there to promote corporate industrial finance addictions and organized religions to ban abortion rights in more places.
"As ecosystems are collapsing, it's the last chance to see them all before they disappear. I'm a nihilist. Just waiting for the world to blow up. 😊"
"I don't really understand how it can be called ecotourism since you are ruthlessly building concrete blocks so you can have as many tourists as possible.

￼"
"It's important that we keep focussing on how to fix and maintain the profit motive throughout our volitional extinction event. After all, it has cost us the earth, we might as well keep at it."
"Travelling the world is one of my favourite things to do and where possible I try not to fly but putting things into context is important. Flying produces about 2.5% of total CO2 emissions and of that a relatively small number of people (super rich etc) account for a huge percentage of those emissions. People should absolutely be conscious of flying and its environmental costs but making bigger pushes to decarbonise energy production, big industry and food production etc has the potential for far bigger changes."
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I like to travel but not to a place where tourists are not welcome. I guess I can look at the place on TV instead .

If they're so concerned about pollution why doesn't the UN put regulations on countries like India and China who are polluting our planet hundreds of times more than America or anyone else for that matter? If you can stop India and China from polluting our planet then come and talk to us.

I watch this video in the school as siraj high school yanouh  with teacher mariam whebi and zeinab sati 💜💜💜
"Save earth , saves us"
"News flash people: plants need C02 to live. They convert C02 and water into sugar and oxygen in a process called photosynthesis. If you get rid of C02, you will kill off the plants and in turn all life on earth will die."
I gotta translate this..
POV: your here for online school
"If you could bring all the clouds and water vapor in the atmosphere to the surface, it would form a ‘liquid’ layer less than an inch deep, and clouds alone would create a layer no deeper than a coat of paint. If just this past year’s carbon dioxide emissions could be confined to an undiluted layer of pure CO2 at the surface of the Earth, the layer would be about 1.5 inches thick. Now, multiply that....."
can someone tell me how this source is less effective??..need it for school

"Wind is no better as a source of energy as the wind power will eventually drain. Especially as you fill the whole earth with windmills, layer after layer speed after speed.
150 years.
The only natural source of electricity from the Earth is solar or Hydro. Because you don't lose any water nor do you lose sunlight."
My students like this video. Thanks it is very educational and really sends the message across.
"Look up silent weapons for quiet wars, climate change is a hoax designed to enslave you. The truth is that our weather is geoengineered by chemtrails. Just for an example, forest fires in California are massive due to aluminum oxide chemtrails that are intentionally there to accelerate them. There is even a NASA study showing that CO2 cools the earth. After all, plants and animals need CO2 to breathe-  so increase your CO2 emissions. Again, this propaganda is being pushed to make you agree with the depopulation tactics of Agenda 2030."
You are only watching this video because of online school
We bang panggil. Gua celek
Me also
No warming since before this was made. There is no climate emergency. The Earth was warmer in the recent and distant past. It also warmed faster in the past.
"Solar panels wind turbines water turbines geothermal title surge energy electric cars vehicles. My favorite of all is hemp.  For makes over 26,000 different things. we will just talk about hemp bio fossil fuel right now. 1 acre of hemp can produce, enough bile fossil fuel to fuel 10,000 vehicles for a year at about a dollar a gallon.  Hemp bio fossil fuel releases the same amount of carbon dioxide un oxygenated air) per mile as a person does when the exhale.  Versus coal oil and gas sand oil ethanol which released tens of millions of years worth of petrified death per mile.   A couple more examples! Hemp has been proven, to be 10 times stronger and 30% lighter than steel stronger and lighter than concrete stronger and lighter than brick.  Easier to work with on-site far more versatile, not to mention you could use it as much as you would like or need. Without leaving any excess toxic waste behind.  So we could rebuild America stronger later cheaper faster than any people have ever built a city town or country.  The real sales pitch.  That sold me by using Hamp!! For everything we can we will be improving and maintaining the quality of our air water food and landscapes( to groundbreaking high standards of quality)  for 1 acre of hemp! Produces 3 to 4 times the amount of oxygen as 1 acre of trees, at the same time it sucks in 3 to 4 times the amount of carbon dioxide as a acre of trees plus it rejuvenates and replenishes the soil back to Garden of paradise type quality after every harvest.  Even, if the land has been previously, stripped robbed and depleted of all its value from overharvesting things like cotton and corn.  Hemp has even been successfully grown on radiated soil.  Hemp has  the same nutritional value, as rice corn and beans wheat barley and milk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           One thing nobody really brings up about global warming.  Is that the hotter it gets.  The more mosquitoes and various other bugs spiders snakes, are going to be slithering crawling flying buzzing  throughout the world."

Solutions are wind turbines solar panels and nuclear energy which are carbon free generators. Electricity cars are solution for transportation."
Yup
"I am sure that over 550 Nuclear tests done in our Stratosphere had nothing to do with it .

Let that sink in..  now think..  now do the math and unless you really do not understand what a Nuclear explosion is i would understand your lack of understanding of this information.

More fake news. It has not been proven that co2 is causing a warming of the atmosphere. It can only do so IF it is enclosed with lots of water.
here sksskkss
Hi sean s
wow
Of course I’m here for online  school (we have to make a speech to the UN about global warming) lol
Ola bit like . An they only one here watching this for oline
"Climate change is already happening but its not severe yet. U notice the weather change? Like in the morning it will rain and in the afternoon it won't rain and in the next day in the morning it won't rain and in the afternoon it will rain, and did u notice that our seasons are vanishing? Here in my country rainy season can be hot and summer season can be rainy or cold and its now always cold here like its always Christmas. So we are killing our planet and ourselves slowly."

"It is now forty years since we were first told of the imminent catastrophe of climate change and how it’s all our fault. Sea levels in England were apparently going to rise by one foot, 32 cm by the year 2000. Our summers were going to be much hotter and winters much colder. Anyone pointing out that global warming and cooling has fluctuated every few hundred years or so. In Roman times Grapes we’re grown as far north as Lincoln and in medieval times the Thanes froze every year allowing a market to be held every winter. In the 1940 and 50 snow came every year to the South of England, now it is scarcely seen. Yes our climate if changing as it always has and it has little to do with human activity."
the presentation is absolute Ecogarbage and pure propaganda
Fun fact: ur getting forced to watch this by school
"I know a solution to stop climate change

how can i get all the transcript of this video ? I wanna practice listening by dictation
"Yes, so warm countries / places are warmer while hot destinations are purely on fire, and mild colder climates where at first will get colder due to melting icebergs in long term are going to get pleasantly warmer and more desirable destinations to live at. I think I got it right living in Canada ❤❤❤"
"2/3 of the world will be unlivable and the ocean will be dead, and the comment section is like ""eh we'll adapt"""
Decades? You have years left. Maybe 5 at most.
The global elites have produced more carbon emissions than the average people. These elites should be regulated more than us.
Why not add CW-7 to the upper layers of the atmosphere and cool down the globe by 50°C. That’d solve the climate crisis wouldn’t it!
as the ice melts it lowers the salt in ocean and that afects the ocean currents causeing them to slow even stop as soon as 2025-2095 the world will be in a new ice age then
"It's all a made up scam.
Never will they stop pumping pollutants into the air.
Credit each other for what emissions they can claim.
They are going to put us all in the poor house over this nonsense. 40 years or more our govt has been playing this card. Enough already."
KEEP CEM-TRAILING WITH ALUMINUM IN IT IT'S LIKE WRAPPING A POTATOE IN ALUMINUM FOIL AND THROW IN OVEN TO BAKE!!!  IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING
you people lie so much its just funny to hear this
soo call lamborghini and ferrari factory to stop sport car production v8  for rich people !!! but you not gonna do that!!😅😅😅 you are JOKERS!!!  is only excuse for politisc to change the law for poor people ...PROPAGANDA
"I found out that at these COPS there are two types of meetings. The 1st are scientists & other people discussing the situation with climate change and proposed ideas. The 2nd is where the very top officials that can do something get together and propose what they are willing to do. But the 2nd one doesn't have scientists, just policy makers and it's all voluntary. There's no one there to hold them to account or demand more."
So the climate is changing like it has always done . We don’t believe your reports because if it was really that serious the elite would give up their private jets and lavish lifestyles for the climate . When they do that maybe the world will take it seriously.
And if we give Justin Trudeau & Chrystia Freeland money they will change climate cycles that have happened on earth for billions of years 😂😂😂 I can’t believe liberal voters still believe that 😂😂😂
Donna Frozen is a disingenuous non-journalist.
Wish it was warmer in Canada now.
"What we have done to our home is “Locked In”
Glad profits are up 💩"
I like global warming because I hate the cold
We need to deindustrialize.
Here we go now All the elite will jump on their private jets fly around stay in fancy hotels to tell us we need to be taxed and give things up so that they can continue to cause 99 percent of the climate change they cry about

So when did the Earths climate not change . The magnetic poles are constantly moving .  We do everything possible to mitigate pollution. Now China ……
World temperature decreased from 1941 to 1979 in the industrial era.
Using fears to rob the poors.
Humanity thinks its a permanent fixture when they are just a anomaly a glitch really. Earth is trying to erase its mistake and rest assured kids it will very very soon.
Liberal propaganda
You don't even bother think before you speak ! How warm was it when the dinosaurs were here😅
"Yay capitalism!  We can get to 3* far sooner than the turn of the century, clearly we're not trying hard enough."
"Global warming  will happen no matter what and not caused by people, this is fear crap for money, sure we help it along but it can't be changed, artic was once a rain forest and deserts had lakes and rivers, this is all liberal lies for money, blame everything on climate change so liberals get blamed for nothing, three or four yrs ago, California burned, water reservoirs where dried, all blamed on global warming and climate change, what they don't say is this all happened in the past, last yr California no fires, reservoirs filled to normal levels and we hear nothing about anything because it's not convenient for the government, they blame everything on climate change and global warming lol!"
"On December 2021, an eruption began on Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai, a submarine volcano in the Tongan archipelago in the southern Pacific Ocean. The eruption reached a very large and powerful climax nearly four weeks later, on 15 January 2022.
How much water vapor did Hunga Tonga put into atmosphere?
 The underwater caldera shot 146 metric megatons of water into the stratosphere like a geyser, potentially contributing to atmospheric warming over the next 5 years, according to a new study published in Nature Climate Change.Mar 16, 2023.

"I`m happy to know that everyone knows answer for every question, and comment it, like in my bar when some are drunk."
Maybe global leaders should fly all over the world to have a photo op with each other to talk about what to do. Imagine that a room full of people who don't know how to do anything trying to solve that puzzle.
"They say in the video without change we're on track for 3C warming by 2100. So they really think it's going take 76+ yrs  to reach 3C? That seems like such a laugh or cry. I think we'll hit 3C by 2040, just 16 years from now because climate change is accelerating & feedbacks are increasing. Did people really think the oceans would absorb the added heat without ever releasing it? It's time to pay the piper. This was ignored too long."
"“And the nations were wroth, and thy wrath came….. the small and the great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth.”
Revelations 11:18
Humans are destroying the earth including the climate… for some reason some Christians think that we are not responsible for the climate change, well, we are, in the same way that we are responsible for extinction of animal species."
"Keep burning down the Amazon, and the forests of British Columbia, what do you think is going to happen.
Human caused fires , an extinction event is due shortly. This would be the 6th Extinction event, the first for humans."
"Last year this time we were under flood till march , so far this year this time we having above thirty  hardly any rain and we still have , five months of summer , if it is now mid summer temps at begging of summer  wow what's end of summer winter going to be like ... 🥵🥵"
we should just get on with solar geoengineering. its patently obvious its the only way we have any hope of getting a handle on this.
The Earth was warmer in the recent and distant past. It warmed faster in the past. There is no climate crisis.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Het bent. Its natural.
1.5 is meaningless. This number was pulled out of at hat. Life flourishes under warming.

with all that has been done to stop global warming. and nothing has improved. do you think your barking up the wrong tree
"This is 🐂💩. We’re in one of the coldest periods of the last 10,000 years. CO2 emissions do not cause climate change."
"lol, I've never said ""the climate grift is real"" before... no way....."
There worried about climate change and there making the people on this planet pay the price but when the ones that call themselves intelligent and started to  test their nuclear weapons on this beautiful planet what did they think would happen now that the planet has had enough of our stupidity and plans to remove us.We started off with a planet that was the garden of eden and we turned it into hell
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
The leaders failed us
"oh no we are all gonna die!

Why dont you cut the crp and just tell us who wants money so we can make a donation and pretend to ""save the world"" ey?

By the way, I was not joking, we are ALL gonna die.....eventually, when enough time passes. Appr. 130 Years from now, the whole Population of Earth, incl. those who are born right this moment, will be DEAD!!!!! 7 Billion People....gone! crazy right?"
All of the dire predictions have been wrong because the fear and profit motive of the predictors are part of the computation

Shouldn’t we all be dead at this point? Seems we keep going even with the constant end of the world scenarios. I’m sick of hearing this garbage and maybe they should think about the immediate consequences of shutting of the fuel to billions of people.
"Its not just fossil fuel.. the axis is still changing... just remember we are only 224 years into proper recorded data, if you belive in God. Which a multiple cultural individual like me does. Just hold faith. God never leaves us out in the cold.

"We are at the top of the benner cycle and the solar maximum 

This is how planets and stars work.  There is no steady state in the galaxy or the solar system.  

The real problem is the billionaires see carbon as a chance to cash in but they do not want to add cost to their factories that spew chemicals and garbage into someone else’s river

Look at this problem that isn’t real
And ignore the one that is"
Its because all countries dont have the carbon tax to fight climate change
Propaganda to increase taxes. government subsidized media manipulating tribalists. nothing to see here
All good things eventually come to an END
Maybe we need more taxes? That seems to fix things right? No? Then give me my money back. Scammers.
Climate change is not man made.

"Earth and the chemistry of the universe controls climate, not a bunch of primates that have be around for a few thousand years,how pig headed and conceited can ""Humanity "" be for gods sake!!!"
"Geologic evidence and proxy data suggest that the earth has been significantly warmer and has had higher CO2 levels in the past, and all sorts of life thrived. This, of course, was before the global flood a few thousand years ago which radically changed the geography and climate of the planet. But there is also evidence to suggest parts of the earth were warmer after the flood than they are today. In fact, historical records indicate there were several warm periods including the medieval warm period (MWP) between AD 300 and 1900 in which people were able to farm in Greenland—an area currently covered in ice.
Warmer temperatures can extend growing seasons, which allows for increased agricultural production. Cooler temperatures can cripple agricultural production as evidenced by the “little ice age” that occurred in 1400 shortly after the MWP. During the “little ice age,” the Thames River in London froze over and much of Britain experienced food shortages."
oh man
Climate change is a hoax
"Absolutely nothing could be done right now, visa vi politics.  Best case scenario, is it wont melt completely.  Too many issues, too many people wanting to live in relative comfort, too many want to just survive, and do almost anything to prolong it.  Especially those with everything to loose, and big egomaniacal or selfish  dreams.  No judgment, everyone would under right circumstances.  If everyone magically, without government decrees would just stop shopping without need, unless green and ethically made, that will prevent the polar melt, maybe better.  Only hope, do you."

thank you
"The earth is just entering a new era. New age. Nature does move on. But most people in this world get the wrong idea and think its the greenhouse effect. Even if electric cars will make it. It still uses gasses, oils and that to build batteries. So we will always create emissions. Natural forrest fires cause emissions. Emissions have been around for 1000s of years. Think of all the fires we had using coal."
What happened to them doing something about global warming seems like nothing is being done to be honest.
"Slight natural climate change ! Ignore the bizarre media panic, it will always periodically vary !!!"
"When was this filmed? During the melting season of course.
The Arctic was ice free about 6000 years ago and it wasn't due to human activity. Those polar bears looked well fed, they've been thriving since the hunting ban treaty was signed in 1973 and they don't need sea ice."

Massive false just like covid vaccine
"Governments don't want to agree to tougher measures (even though most understand they really should), because they know the majority of the people they govern are currently suffering in economical terms and, right now, don't want their leaders additionally telling them what they can and cannot do. 
Governments are literally scared of the consequences of telling their people to scrap their petrol cars, don't fly, reduce/stop eating meat, limit the number of children in a family, don't consume so much, don't waste, make do and mend, grow some of your own food, and plant a huge number of trees. 
It's a lot to accept when you're deciding between heating and eating, or working all hours under the sun (just to keep a roof over your head as mortgage/rent rates go up) - especially when world leaders get to fly first class to these summit meetings, knowing well they'll be enjoying luxurious hotel suites and banquets, making trade deals (that are responsible for more carbon emissions) behind the scenes. 

Scientific concerns for climate change have been brushed under the carpet for far too long in far too many countries, and once it could be ignored no more - our governments are not now in a position to meet the necessary demands while they have to worry about feeding their people, counting the cost of climate driven destruction, what to do with endless streams of migrants turning up on their doorstep, what Putin gets up to next, and what China has in mind.  

It's a good lesson to anyone never to let problems 'pile up' without addressing them at the time they arise. Shame that this is a lesson governments (with the exception of Bhutan) have learned too late."
“What humans do over the next 50 years will determine the fate of all life on the planet.”
"Notice the very first words this paid propagandist utters? ""The moron"" like all religious fruitcakes who believe changes in climate are connected to people's actions. Not all of them are sub IQ morons, many are brainwashed, many profit from the scam, but the rest? Just a religion to fill the emotional void in their lives."
"Coal is very important for the Nordic countries,it drives their Economy, the coal miners are privileged,to have better incomes and safest workplace in a 2km below the ground,underground mine. It’s not a open pit mine, extracting coal is difficult,but the companies have impeccable safety record."
"Climate change is a problem of politics. We have all the means to solve the problem except the political leadership. As of now, our global economy is based on debt-fuelled growth. The current logic is to make everyone richer and hope that trickle-down economics will lift people out of poverty. Rather than addressing inequality by distributing education and resources, and living sustainably. This is why climate change is so hard to solve: it would involve reforming our global economic system and addressing global inequality. So the global elite would have to initiate this reform, painful for them in the short-term. And it would require global coordination. Not probable in the current geopolitical climate."
"It's been much warmer in the past. Once all land was a whole supercontinent, Pangaea, covered with rainforest and surrounded by tropical ocean. Sahara used to be green, people used to swim in the huge lakes there, in only a few tens of thousand years ago. The warmer it get, the more water vaporates from the ocean. The more water vaporating, the more green the planet will get, due to more rain. Imagine Greenland and the enormous territories north of Canada and Russia, and Antarctica turning into habitable places to live. 

More attention should instead be turned to stopping pollution, instead of turning the youth into a nihilistic, depressed, morally dead people that only expect everything to go to hell."
"This reminds me of the recent movie ""Don't Look Up"" with Leo where all people ignored the evidence of a comet coming into collision to Earth, and is not until the last moment, when nothing can be done, when we try to look for solutions. Sad to say but this is also everyone's individual life, is not until the last moment that we try to make a change, out of desperation, because our own individuality is at risk. I'm so sorry for future generations, but also marvelled at how our end is going to be."
Well we're not under water and the polar bears are thriving.

"They're still trying to limit warming to 2C which has been shown as inadequate to prevent planetary biosphere collapse. To put it simply, we are doomed if we reach 1.5C. Carbon capture is a pipe dream because it's not scalable. We are now at around 1.1C."
"So that the Climate Summit does not lose its credibility: The Climate Summit is supposed to be postponed to next year.. due to the continuation of the failed Egyptian government in repressive violations, daily arrests and enforced disappearance of political and opposition activists..

Wow
Little spoiler for you. The planet heats up and cools down in cycles. It has done since inception and before humans arrived. It will continue to heat and cool when humans are extinct. Earth will become barren for around 2 billion years then be consumed by the Sun... the end 😂. Have a fab day 😁

"If world so called ""leaders"" were serious about using clean energy like solar panels or wind turbines they would use Sahara for harvesting Sun energy.

Is less solar irradiation the reason for the warming? Somehow there are still people thinking less sun is warming the Earth.
Very sad our future.
How about using the term warmer rather than hotter.... or is it just put in to make the natural climate cycles changes more dramatic?

"The inability and/or unwillingness to comprehend the Greenhouse Effect on global climate is not only short sighted and problematic, it, also, fails to show appreciation for the fact that life on Earth would not have been possible in the first place if carbon dioxide and methane had not kept Earth from being completely and permanently frozen over."

"Hubris. Humans have no influence over climate change. Climate change is a natural phenomenon. Nobody is denying it exist. It simply happens, just as you have no control over gravity, the change of tides and natural disasters. You have no control over climate change. If you have no control over climate change, how could you claim you have influence it. Be humble. Human activity isn't that great.
 You have no power over the climate, stop spreading lies and misinformation. Bill Nye shame on you."
"so add to this the study of ice ages on the planets sea level and climate, google the last 5 ice ages and find out  how it turned the arctic into a tropical landscape long ago.   as far as climate change/ the POLLUTION of air, land ,and water is what needs to stop . that is where the science must go to and help get it done along with everybody's tax dollars. and after the climate will still change but on it's own terms. news bulletin the magnetic north pole is shifting  more rapidly than ever seen before and that is unexpected.  other scientists say the sun is putting out more heat than normal and is contributing to a warmer planet. just look at mars it used to have water on its surface ,??? were next..........."

Great freaking video Bill Nye team!! Well done!
well it's kind of ironic because the reason the heating and cooling took place in the beginning was because of all the earthquakes we know Haiti moved the Earth 1. 8 in closer to the Sun... So just imagine Pangea rocking the Earth back and forth in its orbit that was the reason the heating and cooling took place the first time part of the reason... It's not hard to put two and two together...
Lead by example

"B.S.

During the Roman occupation of the UK (43AD to 440AD) the climate was so warm they used to grow grapes here WAY before the industrial revolution
funny how you 'scientists' never explain about these little facts in history isn't it?
Climate change has always happened."

"How do so many people get fooled so easily. Carbon, Nitrogen and oxygen are 6,7,and 8 on the periodic table which means carbon atoms are 1 proton or neutron smaller than Nitrogen which is 1 proton or neutron smaller than oxygen. So how can Carbon (the smallest of the three) and being only .04 % of the atmosphere be the main cause of the worlds climate change. So how can Nitrogen being around 78% of the atmosphere not absorb the suns heat but Carbon being 1 proton or neutron smaller than Nitrogen and only .04% of the atmosphere absorbs enough heat from the sun to change the climate to the point of a devastating existential threat. I don't care how long or how often they tell this lie, I will never be so gullible as to believe any of it. Did you notice , not one scientific fact on how carbon atoms absorb enough heat to change climate, It just might be our faults no real reason how.."

He's a good comedian.
No proof. I don't believe that we have anything to do with climate change
"Here is my problem with Climate Change. If we really cared about climate change, or if at least the politicians really cared about climate change then right now as we speak China should be swimming with sanctions due to their effect on climate change.

But no one has demanded or enforced sanctions towards the worlds top polluter.

We can complain about climate change all we want, but if the main producer of pollution in the world does not do anything about it, it does not matter at all how much we talk about climate change or how many agreements we reach on climate change.

If China does not stop climate change then nobody will. 

So lets sanction China, just like we sanctioned Iran. But we can't because that's where America's companies have sent most of their labor. Double fucking standards."
I don't get why people don't believe in this stuff. Especially since we're fucked bc we voted for trump.
Bill Nye is a twat.

Lies
"Bill Nye is  another Climate clown. I like to know has much money Bill has made of his Climate BS?. The planet has been warming for the past 25,000 years ???. It's not human activity...sorry Bill.  80% of all the Carbon that has been produce since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution has happen in the last 20 years. Yet no temperature increase ????   CO2 is plant food... without CO2 we are all dead. Thank God China is burning more coal to say the Earth."
"""On behalf of environmentalists everywhere, I would like to formally apologize for the climate scare we created over the last 30 years. Climate change is happening. It’s just not the end of the world. It’s not even our most serious environmental problem.""

Bill Lie the fake science guy.

"How can this Fossil say with a straight face that the Planet is the Warmest its ever been?
When was the first thermometer invented?? I don't think the Romans and Greeks can claim this sucker?? Who's up next??"
1st of all this liberal ass video is very very biased. 2nd We all know that there used to be oceans in places that are now desserts. There used to be a ice age and none of those events or global changes where caused by man. We have scientific proof that the earth in a way has a mind of its own. All that's happening is the earth is having another change. Weather that means water rises and earth gets hot or water freezes and we get another ice age. It's happend in the past and it is certainly happening still.  And we have only been recording temputures for 100 years and the earth has been around for billions of years. We are barley even starting to understand the earth's patterns.
Bill Nye is a fraud and climate change is a hoax. Prove me wrong.
I wonder if he has read the IPCC reports.
"The argument for climate change must be presented in a calm and rational manner.There are four mindsets in this whole climate change idea. Those who believe in climate change,those who deny it is happening,those who do not believe it and those who do not understand anything about it.That fourth group are the ones who need to be convinced,they are the largest group.They can only be won over with calm and rational arguments,facts and education."
THE DINOSAURS ARE EXTINCT AND THEY'RE THE REASON WE HAVE FOSSIL FUELS THAT COULD LEAD TO HUMAN EXTINCTION?
"good luck. you are just another uninformed do gooder that actually believes the BS that you have been served by the many government funded departments on global warming etc.
Global warming is a scam that started in the 60's by roger revelle and was pounced upon by Al Gore. The UN got involved under Maurice Strong and the IPCC was formed and the hoax grew from there. 
Now, Global Warming is a 4.7 billion dollar industry just in the United States. 
If anyone is serious about finding the truth about ""climate change"" or (man made global warming) then they must be prepared to devote dozens of hours of unbiased research on the internet looking at information from both sides and then making an informed decision on this issue. Reading 1 or 2 websites will not give you the information you need to really understand this complex debate."
If it's bill nye i'll listen
"Basic Science of supply and demand.... Photosenthesis. In order for plants and trees to survive they need sunlight, water and carbon dioxode (CO2). What do plants and trees convert or breath-out? OXYGEN! What do humans and animal need to survive and live besides water and food? That's right! OXYGEN! Everybody is so involved in this CO2 fiasco when we forget that OXYGEN too needs attention. Do we have enough plants and trees to breath-out OXYGEN this days? How many humans and animals are increasing every minute? Do you agree that we are now over populated? If so, do you think we will have enough OXYGEN supplied by planet Earth in the next 50 to 100 years from now? As much as you hate to admit it, we need as much CO2 in order to supply more OXYGEN which is provided by plants and trees. Problem is, plants and trees have been decreasing every year because of illegal logging, forest fires, irresponsible industrialization, etc. By the time we find ways of decreasing CO2 emissions we will now have a new problem in OXYGEN supply. Then we say..... plant more trees and pump up more CO2 so we can get more OXYGEN! Funny how things will turn out that way."
Hi bill - we are very cold in Alberta - can you help to send global heat up here? Thank you.
WAR CREATED GLOBAL WARMING !
CO2 makes up less than .04% of the Earth's atmosphere unbelievable how brainwashed people are
"Wow, I just love that 97% number, cause it´s totally fake, and was extracted from thin air."
BILL NYE FOR PRESIDENT 2020
1 degree per 100 years!? Myyyyy gooood
You can help save the planet because Face Blankets are made from recycled pop bottles.
Bill Nye is not a scientist so I don’t know why they would have him explain it.
"Abrupt increase in temp? On what kind of time scale? Does our STAR affect weather? Does solar minimum affect weather on earth? Do volcanoes affect weather? Are Co2 gases in USA going down or up? Bill is a stooge and only speaks to ""facts"" that support his faulty view. Oh, what about Al Gore saying that Arctic Icecap could be gone by 2014? How is our Icecap now? Antarctic ice NOW? 
On a historic scale (no, not the last few hundred years) weather changes! He is misleading about the Ice as well...look it up yourself."
That bow tie looks suspiciously like polyester to me...
"save the polar bears , what do i tell my children ? ,"
"Bill Nye, hello???  Can't discuss climate change until govts stop playing with their weather modification machine!!!!  Seriously, use common sense!!  Google it. Gov't already told the press years ago while folks were sleeping"
The space to live on this planet will become smaller.  More areas will become uninhabitable within my lifetime.  This is happening in real time.
"this is not more than a nice story, I would prove, an scientifically proofed story. this is nothing, I can say that."
"Ironic how something becomes a political football and a critical crisis right at the same time as we first become able to measure it.
Authoritarians gonna authoritarian."
Bill nye with science that lies
CNN Director of Operations told the world this propaganda was next. All lies.
Do you think humans cause the ice ages?climate change is real.its been changing long before humans existed..
"So when in earth history the climate stop changing? Bill will be gone and none of this hysteria will happen.  if fire will start raining instead of water that for sure a real deal Climate Change. until then, here I am just want Grab some beer and eat banana."
Seems as if the solutions seem to only want to monetize instead of making structural changes based on science. This is what makes part of me doubt climate change. Seems agenda driven.
CLIMATE CHANGE MADE OF HUMAN ARE THE REMOVING OF OIL AND METAL OF THE PLANET 2ND ONLY THE POLLUTION OF AIR AND OCEAN BUT THE TRUTH ARE THE OIL ARE REAL REASON
"This guy should be in prison for inducing panic. His only facts are ""scientists say""."
"Weather is being controlled from outer space..
   Oh and how about calling chemtrails.. Contrails"
"WTF does eat more local vegetables have to do with Climate Change?  The statistic of ""97% of Climate scientist agree"", is made up, I challenge anyone to show the data that supports this."
got the wrong numbers BILLY!!
Bill Nye is a clown.
"While you're at it, challenge the system of Capitalism which gorges itself on consumption and is the dominant form of pollution production. However, this would require getting together with other communities and protesting with solidarity.

can someone send me the answers to the worksheet to this
Bill Nye is evil.
What Happened To You Bill You Changed Since Bill Nye The Science Guy
remeber when bill nye was in a pro oil disney ride? (ellens energy adventure) glad he changed his mind.
So what do you want us to do? Go to live like the prehistoric times?
"Climate change is a phenomenon we don't understand , it's been happening to our earth since earth was created , there's not a thing we can do  about this , humankind did not create climate change , when are these liberals going to wake up !!!"
Proudly presented by Bill Nye
"Global warming is the only ""science"" where every single model has been incorrect.  Global warming is the only ""science"" that wants to put deniers in jail.  Global warming is the only ""science"" asking governments for trillions of dollars a year in taxes to fix.  Global warming is a fucking joke that has always been wrong."
I thought climate change was a hoax fabricated by the Chinese (gineze)
"97% of scientists agree. Just not legit Geophysicists and Oceanographers from NASA, NCAR, MIT, University of Toronto, University of California, Harvard, Skripps and other NON-POLITICAL think-tanks, funded by political parties."
"Ok Bill, you kinda mentioned this then skipped to the graphic showing rising temps over the past 200 years. However global temps have been high before like in the roman period as well as the medieval period and low like in the little ice age and that's just roughly over the past 2000 years. It seems to me that natural large swings in temperature happen from time to time, with or with out human input. considering the fact that we are in essence coming out of the little ice age, why should I be worried? Now perhaps humans are contributing to climate change and a warming however considering the scientific history of global temperatures it seems that if we are, its to a very small degree. Such a small degree to almost be insignificant.  I am more concerned about Acid rain vs CO2."
Hi folks. How specifically is man-made emissions changing the climate? Give me the exact formula. Thanks.
"He's NOT a real scientist, (That's coming from his own mouth) hell, he doesn't even have a degree in any scientific studies that he even represence! He is a paid, tv actor, mouth piece of the deceivers, and go to guy for anything scientific, through the cloak of nostalgia of the kids who used to watch his old tv show. I wouldn't listen to him about anything to do with anything science related and your a fool if you do."
All these scientists are contributing climate change due to an increase in CO2 emissions. The elephant in the room that I've never seen addressed is the amount of trees that have been cut down and amazon jungle that been decimated. These trees and plants do take in CO2 and produce oxygen. Are planets ability to convert CO2 to oxygen has been significantly diminished.
You are very smart
thank you sir for telling us an important issue and make us aware about it.
thats not true most of that charts are from jouranlists not real scientists dr don easterbrook shows that only 2% of scientists actually believe in climate change not 97%. Check out  Dr Don Easterbrook Expose Climate Change Hoax these are real data not made up.
If you want to see the worst debate group on Facebook full of climate change deniers then head over to American Political Debate
This man is a liar plane and simple. None of the things he said are true. They can't even measure the Earths temperature. What a fool and clown!

"Why stopping the video when it is pointing the finger on the real problem ? We are 7 fucking billion. Experts estimate the world population to 9 billion by 2050 and 12 billion by the end of the century. THIS is the real problem. People are living longer and longer and poor countries are developing like crazy.
We are limited in space and resources. This can not go on forever.
Either we regulate the population in a global scale or prepare for the worst. And by worst I mean Soylent green..."
Ive always thought about this. Are we fucking up the environment? YES! Will life carry on after we fuck up the earth? Yes! Should we stop being dicks and stop ruining the ecosystem? Yes!

"Climate change was always natural, how do you think the ice ages happened and ended so many times?
Of course i'm not saying we shouldn't care, i'm saying everyone is freaking out about something that is not that urgent.
Every year countries and people invest money on organizations that promise to change it, but the only way to change it of course is healthier enviroment, such as reflorestation and scientific research to find useful, more organic solutions."
"The planet will be fine. But will we?

Edit: Ok apparently I need to clarify: I'm not saying it's a good thing, or that the planet will be just as good as it was before, merely that WE are the delicate ones who need very specific conditions in which to exist, and when we've made the planet inhabitable for human life, Earth will continue without us. I am NOT saying that we shouldn't worry about climate change and that humans are all that matters *smh*."
👏👏👏👏👏
Its also about other species well being as well. Fuckin humans......
"its a scam, a bit of warming wont do shit."
*Beautiful (& renew) video and excelent editing.*
Really well done!
Earth is just a rock in space. It doesn't care about us or anything happening on its surface. We need to stop climate change to save ourselves.
"fuck climate change, do we really need more chinese or indian people?"
Awesome video . Finally a good channel with good videos ! Subscribed
Surprised there's not a lot of dislikes.
Climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenom
Seems Christ is coming soon.
This video is just great
out of all the climate change films i've seen & things I've read this was the best I've seen. In that in just 2:45 minutes you produced such a clear message of the key problem that everyone should hear & know.
Donald Trump : Made up by Chinese
Yes it is this is very serious stop sticking your heads in the sand it won't just go away
Stop worrying about climate change and do something that helps. Cheap reliable energy for poor people in Africa.
kewl video
we must do something or we all gonna die by the end of this century!   :O
"This should be a longer video. I know +Vox doesn't do long videos. But if they do, it should be this one. There's way more things to say about it and many things to get deeper into. Still good video, tho."
we didn't evolved so many wrong information link me your resources atheists ?
Great video! This is exactly what I tell people when I talk about climate change. The world doesn't need us. We are the most vulnerable species. We need the world.
"I feel like we've gotten this INCREDIBLE miracle that is the stable climate that allowed us to develop to this level of tech. Shouldn't we be banking right now? As in shouldn't we take what we have right now and dive full into finding a way for us to survive once the weather starts going nuts again?  Shouldn't we be building geothermal underground cities, and finding ways to synthesize food and water, and all sorts of other things, because this could all collapse at any moment?"
Wow.
"the ""scientific method "" used in determining that humans are the main driver for climate change has proven to be false. One way to validate a hypothesis is through predictions and not one prediction has come to pass. Another way is through repeatable experiments and that hasn't been applied to validate their hypothesis. So far nothing has been proven beyond the normal warming trend since the last mini ice age."
"@1.42 when you mentioned carbon you went from serious commentary to disney fairy tale. Not an iota of robust proof exists to prove this co2 ""control knob"" fallacy."
The very last sentence... Something that the human race has never seen before. Let that sink in.
what is the song in the beginning?

after this explanation some people still do not get the point.

well actually it is hehe"
Utter nonsense.
Does anybody know what the first background music is?
I've been arguing this concept for a while now
everything is connected. If you talk about the earth you talk about people at the same time and vice versa. There is no separation. We act and the earth respond. The earth act and we respond. Let each one of us love nature and earth will nurish you back. Let us teach that to our children as well.
This video is sooo true!

the great global warming swindle completely destroys this bullshit myth
Kinda of hope we all die. Humans abuse animals and kill each other for fun instead of survival like natural animals do. We did it to ourselves by refusing to be responsible for out footprints
0:55 wait wut. Where did we get this? How do we know this?
Why don't we tax volcanos they fuck up the globe. Hahahahahahahahaahahahahaha cracks me up!
"it's also kinda not just about us, but also the other living beeings on Earth?"
"lol I always thought this too. It's not the earth that's in trouble, it's us."
"Meh... this is nothing new... George Carlin also said that, 20 years ago (watched it almost 10 years ago). The planet's fine... we're f#@%ed."
Earth has never had an ideal climate for humans. Hence why we live indoors.
Whell now we almost don't have any snow in the netherlands... And the lowest temperature without night is FUCKIN 1- CELCIUS WTF
PLEASE the music piece in the beginning !? anyway thx for your videos they are always great to watch !
"I know my last comment was off topic, so now one that is on topic.

With climate change, you can help tremendously! For short trips, ride a bike. For long ones, of course use a car. You don't really need more than one car per person (that has a lisince). Their are plenty of other ways to help the earth, all you have to do is think green! C'mon guys, help save the world one step at a time!"

"Vox, if you have a good quality video, please don't ruin it with a retarded click bait title - the people who made the video clearly put in a lot of effort and you really degrade there work with that idiotic title."
"This is so almost true, but knowing how the human race is selfish and individualist, i do not approve this message. Yes the planet will survive climate change, yes the ones that can afford survival will, but the only way we can truly survive at a very low cost is doing it together. We need to change our devastating consumption habits that are centered around one thing: greed. Who doesn't agree?"
"Wow... That was.. Amazing, and I knew it wasn't the climate but our civilization but this explained it a lot better"
"This video is amazing, would love to watch a whole documentary about this topic."
Yet we've still got backward fucks that think the world was created by a man in the sky.
"It’s a good video, but I am bothered by the stark lack of what impact climate change will have on the broader global biodiversity. Too many species of already vulnerable plant and animal will genuinely go extinct within this century - that’s one of the things I focus on in this subject, big time."

"As long as we're talking about timelines, and how short of an amount of time we've been on the planet, and how its even shorter that we've been using fossil fuel...
...it should ALSO be noted that its been a VERY short amount of time that we've been able to actually physically monitor temperatures.
All other data, the data that goes back ""tens of thousands"" of years, is based off of ice core samples. Its literally ""proxy"" data, or a suggestion that we MIGHT know what the temperature was in a certain area of the planet only on certain days where the ice packed.  And from that.... we're trying to chart the temperature changes by fractions of a degree over millennia.
So as someone who loves science, I find it completely insulting when its suggested that we ""know"" what is happening on temperature trends over the ENTIRE planet by taking proxy measurements over millennia on one area of the planet, and extrapolating that as us knowing what happened all over the world.  Its further insulting that we literally change data from older weather instruments because we know that the data was flawed, but we presume to be able to ""guess"" how to correct that data.
And then there is the observation thing; that if you start observing anything from a fixed point in time, you'll be convinced that any trend you see is something important.  No matter if it happened before."

ok so we are going to try and stop a runaway freight train and balance it on a knife edge. Himmmm sounds like quite a challenge..... hope they have the controls figured out or it is going to get real bumpy real fast.
It looks like extinction of human is inevitable but how much time we have before that t is important.
Unless we stop thinking about money we can save the planet but I don't think we would
"I think when you heard the phrase ""save the planet"", you misunderstood it, its means in short ""save the biosphere as we know it"", but that is too long so we say save the planet. Its great that you're providing people with info they probably didn't know, but I don't think anyone was wrongly informed if they were talking about saving the planet"
It reminds me Jurassic Park
"So much truth is this video! Well done, Vox 🙌"
i dont agree with this facts. archeologists have found civilizations that have been on this earth tens of thousands  years ago and had technologies that we dont have till this date.
why is this video so short

"hahaha, what a stupidity, the ice in the earth poles is a record high, find oit for your selves, they have to be melted, CO2 Is the plants oxygen hahaha, this video is so lame I had to lough, check facts and stop paying atention to ignorant ideas with no facts to support them."
"This is total nonsense!   The ocean of tropospheric water vapor is the cause of the greenhouse gas temperature forcing effect in earth's atmosphere by hundreds of times over all the other non condensing greenhouse gasses combined.   A reasonable estimate  of increased average global temperatures since preindustrial times due to human caused carbon dioxide emissions is 1/100°C!  The temperature average temperature rise since preindustrial times is given at 1.1°C.  

 It is impossible for non condensing greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide and methane to have created this increase in temperature.   If you read the International Panel on Climate Changes reports they very state their air samples were taken at 20,000 meters well into the stratosphere; whereas, the greenhouse gas effect takes place in the troposphere.   Water vapor in the stratosphere is near zero and the charts and graphs in the IPCC reports that include water vapor appear to be using water vapor concentration from the stratosphere.   Since the IPCC is very transparent on where they got their air samples from the educated reader should know the conclusion will be based that data.   This transparency makes the conclusion although incorrect it is not fraud.  

A simple understanding of the water tropospheric water vapor's control over the greenhouse gas temperature forcing effect on earth is this:   1% of the troposphere is water vapor and 0.04% is carbon dioxide.   1%/0.04% = 25,   tropospheric water vapor is 25 times more concentrated than carbon dioxide in the troposphere where the greenhouse gas effect takes place.   The concentration  ratio is not quite the same as 25 molecules of water vapor to 1 CO2 molecule, but it is close enough for a rough estimate.   Water vapor is a strong greenhouse gas with a carbon dioxide greenhouse gas equivalent of 18 CO2e.   25 X 18 CO2e = 450 CO2e.  On average tropospheric water vapor is 450 CO2e to 1 CO2 CO2e.  All the other greenhouse gasses total up to less than the greenhouse gas effect of CO2, but for giving them presence in this ratio they are given 1 CO2e here.  This gives the troposphere a total of 452 CO2e to 1 CO2e for CO2 or carbon dioxide is 1/452 of the greenhouse gas effect in earth's atmosphere.   Carbon dioxide from human emissions is stated to be 40% of this in this video.   1/452 X 4/10 = 0.000884955752212 or 0.0885% less than 0.1%.   Global warming appears to be real, but it is impossible to be from non condensing greenhouse gasses."
"It annoys me massively that the world's governments aren't trying hard enough to prevent climate change, and that some of them don't even believe it. Instead of banding together to solve important issues like these they just squabble over money and politics. "
Propaganda is fantastic! When did the movement move from killing Jews to climate change??

"Here in America, What needs to be done is fixing the election process once and for all securing it from the republicans and neocons and other outsiders hacking into it and stripping the people’s vote! Then get them and their fossil fuel contributors OUT of office and away from our legislative process!! And I’m sure the same corruption is going on in many other places on this earth!"
"Not a single bit of evidence has ever been able to tell us how much greenhouse gas production is actually human caused, and nothing has ever been able to tell us how much is too much greenhouse gases... some studies show we are killing the Earth by burning fossil fuels and heating the Earth up, some studies show that the greenhouse gases would have increased to current levels and further even if we had never burned fossil fuels... also, many global warming studies show the greenhouse gas increase as the reason the ice caps are melting, what if the ice caps melting were the cause of the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases..."

"@WillMePHD, really?
Have you ever tasted the effect of something with a very powerfull tast like coffee, Aspartame, bitter drugs and so on? A very small drop in your glass can have a huge impact on the tast of the drink. Aspartame makes up about .03% of diet coke, yet gives it a sweet taste. You see, it is just like that with CO2 and greenhouse effect, CO2 makes up a small portion of atmosphere, but yet has quiet a big impact on earths atmosphere. If you think about it logically, there is no reason to conclude that a small substance could not have a big impact, just think about the diet coke."

i don't get why a lot of people in the comments are so confused about the Tetris analogy when the video is so clear about it even an 8 year old would understand. I think sometimes adults just think too much they make everything confusing for themselves.

the amount of climate change deniers on this thread are alarming
"Wow! Joss Fong of Vox! I hope that more information about climate change includes deforestation and destructive practices of animal agriculture. CH4 or Methane is not as large as CO2 carbon dioxide in amount released, however, it is more potent in its effect as a greenhouse gas. I also would have hoped that in the Tetris analogy the game would have started to speed up with overpopulation, melting of icecaps, refugees who left flooded areas due to the tide, heat increase and acidification of the ocean."
"I am a climate change denier. Not because I think we as a human race are incapable of affecting our global climate, (consider the CFCs and the hole in the O-zone layer), but because the data on global climate change does not convince me. It's as simple as that. For instance, in 2006, it was ""global warming,"" now it's been revised to ""global climate change"" with an emphasis on increased natural disasters. Is global climate change really the cause? or could it simply be that we have greater populations in more areas around the globe, with more sophisticated equipment to measure our weather? and maybe it just so happened that the Earth had a tumultuous few years in the 00's as part of it's natural cycle? I've not been able to find any reliable information to dispute this hypothesis, and I know I'm not the only one whose asked. If the data were convincing, I would be more than happy to support agendas to help restore the Earth's natural climate cycle, but as it stands, there are still too many unanswered questions, and not enough data in my view."

"Not as much tetris, as a game of Jenga: we are removing the stored blocks down low in the ground, and stacking them above, in the atmosphere/ oceans, the more we disturb the location of the energy/carbon, the more difficult it is to stabilize, like a rickety Jenga tower."

"I've heard it said that the other planets show warming trends as well.  I also hear that the temperature appears to LEAD the CO2 changes in the temperature history, suggesting that temp increases cause the oceans to release more CO2, instead of the causal arrow going the other way.  I've also heard that there has been no significant global warming over the last 15-19 years, in spite of anthropogenic CO2 production being at record rates...  Anyone care to answer these for me?  I'd love to know."
This is boring
"i don,t get it from one point of view in our energy sources like electricity  we use nuclear and other fossil fuels to generate heats in order to create steam to drive turbine then condense it from sea or other water sources one could say we are using the dormant heat and pouring it in our environment beside co2 isnt that real problem since that hot water become part of ocean and atmosphere"
"It is amazing to me that so many people don't bother to examine the evidence provided that supports the idea of man made global warming. the fact is the only thing powering this phenomena  is the media, and we know that they will say anything when the price is right and cover up the truth just as readily. this is a scam people.
I am very concerned about our environment and the damage big business is doing to it. It is big business that is funding the media campaign promoting man made global climate change, are you sure you want these psychopathic morons to have even more of the worlds wealth and power?    "
Joss fong used to be here
"So, the influence that cosmic rays have over the climate is... irrelevant, right?
The knowledge that at some point we had 5 to 10 times the level of actual CO2 and yet lower temperatures, is also... irrelevant.
There is a clear correlation between the amount of cosmic rays in the galaxy, the Earth's position on it, and the sun's activity.
But again, it is also... irreleveant."
"well made video, ted-ed (as usual ;)) simple,to the point and well designed. the finale about how a tetrus game(and Earth) can end, really makes you think."
"This is not settled science.  Please do not present it as settled.  The anthropogenic warming hypothesis still needs more solid proof.  I applaud those working to prove it, but they have not done it yet.  Until then, it should be presented as an hypothesis."

"Theory != Fact, presenters of theories have made it a habit of presenting as fact to get attention. There are more gases in the atmosphere then just Oxygen and CO2.  Sulfur for example re-fractures the sunlight giving a red hue, reducing heat and is also produced in burning fossil fuels.  Don't forget water, Nitrogen, Helium, etc.  Should consider whats happening the ratio all together. "

There has been no warming since this was made (UAH v6). There is no climate emergency. The Earth was warmer in the recent and distant past. It also warmed faster in the past.

"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:

00:06 🌍 *Earth's carbon cycle, like Tetris, involves the constant movement of carbon blocks entering and leaving the atmosphere through various natural processes, forming the engine of life.*
00:34 🌡️ *Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, traps the sun's heat in the atmosphere, creating the greenhouse effect that prevents Earth from freezing. Increased carbon in the air leads to a warmer planet.*
01:01 ⛏️ *Human activities, like burning fossil fuels and deforestation, introduce additional carbon blocks into the atmosphere, disrupting Earth's Tetris game. The carbon increase since 1750 has accelerated climate change.*
01:31 🚗 *Fossil fuels, derived from ancient plant and animal remains, power human civilization but contribute to the Tetris challenge by adding more carbon blocks. Deforestation further hinders block removal.*
02:00 🌊 *Climate change, driven by excess carbon dioxide, intensifies the greenhouse effect, melts polar ice caps, raises sea levels, threatens coastal areas, disrupts ecosystems, and results in more extreme weather events.*

Since when has that been a source of CO2?"
"This is so wrong ! Climate change is driven almost entirely by the sun, , planetary weather on our solar system and cosmic rays . Just a very little portion is influenced by green house gases."
I got married in 1975 Oct 25th it was a hot sunny day glorious the same as Oct in 2023 it was maybe a little hotter in the north of England .The glaziers are melting they always have since the Ice Age it is what ice does it Melts. The weather is all over the place that is because Governments like China / America are using chemical from planes leaving chem trails to disrupt weather patters its a bio war against each other to disrupt countries and sometimes they drift in the atmosphere over countries that they were not intended for. The reason Climate Change was voice is it raises taxes against companies i.e wrapping. waste. petrol anything that Governments can raise money on. WAKE UP PEOPLE get real stop being sheep led by the nose and following world Government misinformation indoctrination. To the people working for our Government setting fire to dry grass in the summer times Stop we know exactly how these fires have been started ARSON.
Biggest scum. Your scientists are idiots!
The demon-rat cult went too far.
A lot of the fires you showed have been started by man(arson).
Considering that CO2 takes ten years from the time it is emitted to have an affect on climate it would seem that we have already blown the 1.5 degree target!
"Global warming is not caused by the greenhouse gas behavior of CO2 or other greenhouse gases!   Global warming has been stalled at about 1°C since 1991 when global warming was reported at 1.1°C.  In late 1994 it was announced for unknown reasons global warming had suddenly paused in the early 1990s.  In 2022 global warming was reported at 1.06°C typically rounded to 1.1°C. 

Climate Change as marketed by the United Nation's IPCC has a disclaimer at the back of the nearly 200 page IPCC science report where it states they only took their greenhouse gas samples at 20,000 meters altitude which is far into the stratosphere.  It is high school taught science that no greenhouse radiant energy exists after 20 meters from the earth's surface.  After 20 meters from the radiating surface all greenhouse radiant energy has been completely absorbed by greenhouse gases.  Its further heat transfer is by convection i.e. gas molecules bumping into each other.  

The IPCC statement of taking greenhouse gas samples at 20,000 meters altitude and only that one altitude is a legal back stop to protect the IPCC authors from fraud prosecution, because it can be argued a reasonably high school educated person will know there are not active greenhouse gases at that altitude and that the IPCC is NOT dealing with earth's greenhouse effect.  The IPCC science report actually does not flatly state human caused greenhouse gas emissions are causing global warming.   This is analogous to a beverage advertised as ""All Natural Fruit Flavors"" then reading the ingredients it states ""contains no actual fruit juices"".  

Earth's greenhouse effect is frequently used as the model of system always in saturation from the strong greenhouse gas water vapor.   A system in saturation can not be made to have more effect by increasing its active elements.   Earth's greenhouse effect adds 10°F (5.55°C) to earth's average temperature and takes place within 20 meters of the surface.   At average 1% tropospheric water vapor 99-1/2% of earth's greenhouse effect is from water vapor.  

The first reason people should know increasing greenhouse gases can not cause global warming is because greenhouse gases are only active in earth's greenhouse effect which is taught as system always in saturation.   The 2nd is there is no greenhouse radiant energy taught to exist after 20 meters from the surface and the IPCC only took its greenhouse gas samples 20,000 meters altitude and a 3rd is global warming has remained at about 1°C for over thirty years to the present 2023 with no significant increase of 2/10°C since the late 1980 with no correlation with rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere."
"Do scientists actually say this rubbish or is it just activists and the media who interpret the opinions of a minority of scientists who say there Might be something changing in the climate and man might have some responsibility into The oceans are boiling and the poles are on fire!
Every actual scientist that I have communicated with and some who qualify as climate scientists say that humans have significantly more influence over the climate through the built environment than through carbon emissions . And most of that influence is local and a lot of it is through bad math caused by the collection of bad data.
Climate change alarm was invented by politicians as a means to spread socialism. There’s is so much proof of this it can’t be denied, on many occasions they openly state their agenda."

"I hate to rain on your green parade, but drastic reductions in oil production arguably will trigger the price of oil and gas to go up, which will cause the price of everything to go up, including green technologies like Electric Vehicles.

"My response after seeing this video is that I am concerned about the deforestation, because forests play an important role in supporting life on earth. Forests are a source of oxygen that we breathe to survive. There will be many problems that arise if we continue to use the existing forest without replanting it. These problems are like the glass effect that arises from human activities that produce CO2 gas. If deforestation continues, no one absorbs CO2 further, the effect of these greenhouse gases cancels global fires which have an impact on glaciers, drought, forests, causing habitat for these animals to become extinct and causing the ecosystem on earth to become unbalanced."
Don't take any of this lightly. Please- don't you care about yourselves and and your families? Your friends and ancestors to come? None of them will be here if we don't make our change. None of them.

Not all forestry is deforestation and pretty much all trees cut are replanted
Animal agriculture and greed are the ones to blame.
"Hutan sangat berperan penting bagi kehidupan makhluk hidup. Seperti yang telah dikatakan dalam video tersebut, bahwa hutan adalah habitat atau tempat tinggal bagi 80% tumbuhan dan hewan . Penggundulan hutan dapat menimbulkan efek yang sangat luar biasa. Efek yang akibatkan penggundulan hutan yaitu emisi gas rumah kaca yang menyebabkan efek rumah kaca. Seperti yang kita ketahui, efek rumah kaca berkaitan erat dengan pemanasan global. Oleh karena itu, pemanasan global akan semakin bertambah tiap tahunnya. Selain itu, efek sampingnyalagi adalah kepunahan. Sekitar 4 sampai 6 ribu spesies telah punah akibat penggundulan hutan. Sehingga keanekaragaman hayati dalam hutan tidaklah seimbang. 

Forests are very important for the life of living things. As has been said in the video, that the forest is a place to live for 80% of plants and animals. Deforestation can have biggest effects. The effect from deforestation is the emission of greenhouse gases which causes the greenhouse effect. As we know, the greenhouse effect is closely related to global warming. Therefore, global warming will increase every year. Besides, another side effect is extinction. About 4 to 6 thousand species have become extinct due to deforestation. So that the biodiversity in the forest is not balanced."

"This video is a bit misleading. There are more trees on the planet now than there were in 1800. It turns out that it's actually in lumber companies' and governments' interest to keep their natural resources secure (who knew?), so they plant several trees for each they topple.

The real issue is habitat destruction. Yes, new trees are being planted, but old growth forests provide critical habitat for species, and felling these habitats endangers them. The issue isn't CO2."

"So when you fell a tree they immediately release the CO2 ? What kind of bullshit is that ? :D
The carbon dioxide is stored in the wood (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin etc.) and isnt just released the second you fell it.
Its released when you burn it for example.
The other issue with the video and the description is the fact that they say that 30% of the planet is covered by forests.
Thats also bullshit.
Dont get me wrong, deforestation is a bad thing but as a Youtube channel with over 6 million subscribers you cant just make up alternative facts.

Those in the U.N. are asleep at the wheel, and they don't even give a damn in any case. We already are seeing up and coming economies like India and China playing catch up with burning fossil fuel at an unprecedented rate, that puts us in the shade compared to the ""Industrial Revolution"" that we face in the last century."

The heatwaves and droughts of the past were much more severe. Check the past!!
The Roman and medieval warm periods were much warmer. The Danes settled a new land, farmed it for a few hundred years and called it Greenland, but had to leave because it became too cold. The English grew grapes to rival French wines. It’s not warm enough now."

The second is Perception, we can measure and see that climate change is real and having a negative affect on the world.  The third is Practical, right now we have no practical solution to solve our energy needs which is driving climate change and that's the problem.  Wind doesn't work, solar doesn't work, nuclear might work but requires huge amount of water, a limited resource."

"Plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere and retain it. When they die it is released back into the atmosphere. 
Oil and coal contain carbon because they are plants that were deeply buried in the earth during past cataclysmic events.
They fermented and decomposed under unusual circumstances beneath the surface, therefore the carbon they contained was trapped and did not return to the atmosphere.
Burning and exhuming these substances releases the carbon that was denied reentrance into the atmosphere in the past.
You are only returning to the air what was once already there."

"Lost of (????)L daily as a  form of vapor of water from the ground,has a big effect to rise or reduce of temperature by veiling the rays of the sun,and decreasing the earth's radiation...
Vapor condensation creates clouds that veil the sun totally,earth and atmosphere  ...
This a mount of water vapor became produced from(seas and oceans)...
This means,the percentage of water vapor which produced from the ground and the (seas&oceans )is difficult...
This means the pressures of the air in the atmosphere are different too...
This case means the change in the directions of winds,which some called climate change and some called global warming, and then NINO and then LANINA, and this year they called global cooling...
Results :
These directions of winds, must be balanced...

"This is an older video.. outcomes remain but past 1C already and well on our way to 2C... smh.

One thing our 'science' does not reflect is that heating in the past was relatively slow compared to our literal pedal to the metal exhaust of CO2. In the past, water would melt along with the slow release of CO2 and that increase in water would have a 'cooling' effect on the climate... right now, the ice is melting but is nowhere near what it will be based on current CO2 levels... BTW - our current CO2eq is probably 505ppm (May 2017)."
Takes the controls of Harp away from theUN and that will be the end of climate change.

If they where Critical thinkers they should realize that they are just amateurs trying to understand a very complex problem that thousands of experts devote there life to understand a tiny bit of the puzzle. A typical case of dunnig-Kruger effect.

To realize that we don't know should be a clear sign to take the ""safest"" way possible.  Better realize afterwards that we where wrong about climate change but at least we gained the knowledge in the safest way. Then the other way around. 

So what about if the case of this video will be the outcome of global warming.  What can we do?

Most of the ""scary"" outcomes this video suggests doesn't sound so scary to me. Yes we have to produce much more energy to produce water out of seawater and actively plant woods continuously. And people have to move. And people have to be more careful of heat in the summer like people always done in the desert part of the world.  Then we have new labour  society of robots soon enter the workforce to help us do all this..

"Water vapor is the predominant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and helps to maintain the planet’s temperature. As carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases are added, this amplifies the greenhouse effect which further raises temperatures. Besides hiking evaporation rates, the warmer air is able to hold additional water vapor. Warmer global temperatures, also, ramps up the rate at which permafrost and oceanic hydrates melt, thus releasing more and more ‘methane’. This further amplifies the greenhouse effect and increases temperatures that again, in turn, causes increased levels of evaporation and melting. The even warmer atmosphere can now hold even more water vapor, which, of course, is a greenhouse gas .....

TL/DR - oh bother.
We are already reaching this point and its almost 2023.. going to watch the 4-6 warmer video to see what coming in the next 5-10years.. God Help us All ... =(
Love the flat earth graphics!!
"its amazing how little time on the news and tv climate change is given. We're looking at a possible extinction of the human race, and complete ruin of this beautiful, and only world we call home. Governments need to stop caring so much about money and work to try and heal this planet as best they can"
"This reminds me a bit of Wake Up, Freak Out."
California Could Get hurricanes if it happens
We F’d boiz
Look at the hurricane in Florida now worst ever we dont have long left on this planet 20 to 50 years the most
"A quick warming factoid. The units are Zettajoules / year:
                           warm the   melt the
                            ocean        ice
Deglaciation:        1.6           1.3
2000-2018 AD:    13.7          0.18
""Deglaciation"" is the annual average over 12,500 years of significant sea level rise 20,200 to 7,500 years ago, averaging 10.5 mm / year and always >2.7 mm / year.
""2000-2018 AD"" is the annual average over 19 years of 2000-2018 AD.
One conclusion is that the ocean has already started warming but the ice hasn't started melting yet.
Incidentally, the  13.7+0.18=13.88 / year is the precise measure of what's referred to as ""climate lag"" or ""in the pipeline"" for future increase of Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) right now."
Global increase 2-3 degrees.Amazon rainforest will be disappeared.There will be more CO2.Is look bad.
LOL the graphic shows hurricanes being half the size of the United States. Do people actually believe this is real?
Methane = by 2025 bye bye everyone!
"Well, this is all already happening. Here we go."
FAKE NEWS
that is cool ..
"The idea of climate change, like BLM and METOO,  is radical now"
violently de commodify necessities for all the worlds people or watch humans go extinct. there is no other option
"Don't economists know how to do math? I thought that was a big part of the profession? Anyway, how do you save the forests when over 80 million new people are being born each year and each one needs at least ten acres of land? That's 800 million acres of land equivalent needed EACH YEAR. Do the math and report back."
deforestation will stop money eventually but I mean who is smart enough to get that
Beautiful scenes
Very well explained and illustrated!
Have anyone heard about Ecosia?
Still pushing this GREEN GARBAGE?
Yea to Costa Rica.
"Use money to buy more land to plant more trees,not to buy car 7:29"
"Didn't watch the video but for starters: yes, stop buying soy beans and palm oil"
"Why don't you also explain about the foreign mining companies operating in the forest, some of which are English, Canadian, and Norwegian, and also from other countries, mostly European, many of them illegally?"
Nature doesn't negotiate
"21 % it looks familiar,does it has to anything with India I think"
"@3:25 Incentivizing South and Central America to reforest areas is condescending and patronizing, especially when Europe has had deforestation issues for hundreds of years and no one is pressuring them to reforest their lands. It needs to be everyone in it at the same level, not just Black and brown countries and continents expected to maintain healthy ecosystems for the betterment of the world's climate change dilemma. ""Carbon credits"" are just European and colonized lands (Australia, US, Canada, etc.) using the idea of helping incentivize these Black and brown countries to conserve forest area so that European and colonized lands are let off the hook for their carbon emissions and lack of forested area due to deforestation."
The Amazon must be preserved!
never thought that being taxed for the air you breath would become a reality
Another excellent 👌 program.   Congratulations
Fantastic documentary
The number of puns/double entendres and wordplay in this video is turning me green
"If Environmentalists get their way and fossil fuels are banned it is estimated it would take 2 years for most of the worlds timber to disappear. This is because renewable power is not cheap, reliable or available and will require mining on a scale not imagined. To save the world the climate cult will destroy the world. Nuclear energy is the only solution which is why hundreds of nuclear power plants are in the works. Every country that went into the green dream failed. Not one made it through the transition. Any country that thinks they can rely on sea breezes and solar is completely deluded and will fail as did every country that tried. 
The Economist did not mention any of this. Fail"
"*Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.🇺🇲*"
Ireland has less than one percent of its ancient forest left. I hope that won’t be the case for the Amazon.
Messed up..
"nop , 
money is the ultimate cause of all"
"Generally, the economy is better at conserving valuable assets than government ❤"
Climetchange.covid19.mentelhelth
"I don't see the big deal, just plant more trees😒"
"Massive scope of scam, very low possibility of success"
We have replanted billions of trees . In the United States we have replanted so many that we actually have more tree todays than at the turn of the last century (1900) . The climate alarmists are pushing false science they cheery picket . As if you go back to Egypts time the planet is cooler by 3 degrees. So these chickens little alarmists should be ashamed of themselves. They haven’t got one climate model right in over 60 years. These are facts.
👍😊
"Atractive women with high intelectuality is essentinal to motiveate to go no with conservation, and the economist makes atractive videos with atractive women, they are the fuel to capture interest on this subjects."
"Printing money to buy trees will do the opposite, because the resulting inflation is exported to dollar-holding countries and keeps them financially repressed. Switch to sound money and make poor people rich so they are able to care about the environment."
Deep drilling activities in the ocean and land by oil rig giants is also one of the main reason for climate change as well as biodiversity destruction...!!!
Forests being destroyed to make arable land mostly used to produce animal feed stuffs. Extremely destructive and wasteful way to produce protein when plant based protein only requires a fraction of that space.
Actually oceans capture way more carbon than trees
nice content but too hard to hear
"Many other reasons offsets are not the silver bullet. Nonetheless, bravo!!"
satellite photos show massive greening of the earth due to higher CO2 levels.  Semiarid areas now support plant growth where before low rainfall levels were insufficient.
"Reforestation is one of the great success story, China Green Wall?"
Propaganda cucks
"The common people can by planting trees…with 7 billion people living on earth if each individual planted a tree.

THIS one action would definitely OFFSET the greedy corrupt corporate elite!"
"Every financial goal requires patience, dedication and consistent spirit knowing that investment is currently the most lucrative business in the world, both NFT, real estate and Crypto shares are really positively changing people's lives."
"It would be an elegant solution considering that money caused it.   But yes for someone to contrive a system to make it more profitable for the people in power not to destroy the planet, to make them want to decarbonize if you will would be a work of masterpiece.   Such a person would be worthy of Mt. Rushmore, ""and more"" lol"
"90% TAX for the MEDIA and the WOKE ELITES and use the money to PLANT TREES!
MAKE PUBLIC ALL THOSE THAT COMPLAIN!!
They pretend to care about the Planet so much that you may believe they will actually AGREE TO BE TAXED TO SAVE THE PLANET.

How about we give it a try!?"
Can't stop climate change acceleration caused by humans if humans are alive. None of us will give up our comfortable lives. Let it happen.
Rich countries should lead by example. This what the USA could really lead the rest of the world by pushing not only improving man-made and nature infrastructure. Construction of high speed rail and reforestation of lands currently being taken up by the interstate highway system.
"Since my childhood I have observed nature around me here in Kenya and each day I make an observation I get sad ...I began planting trees as at the age of 15..and it became a culture in me,..Today am 27  and I have grown 6500 trees that have natured to maturity...I am pleased with the new environment and microclimate the trees created but am sad because sometimes am depressed economically and am tempted to cut the trees down .I have hesitated in search of carbon funds in vain. Where is that fund here in Kenya"
"The vast majority of pictures they show you of ""deforestation"" is actually tree farming. This is a SUSTAINABLE system where you cut down a tree and then plant one in the same spot. Give it a few years and it is ready to be cut again."
There has to be some limit to compulsive hunger in humans however selfish we are.
"Stewardship is fine as is aesthetic & virtue, but don't be a complicit shill or worse exploit perpetuate deceive impose irresponsible reckless harm violate evade accountability ... ClimateCon among conniving corruption exceeded by ludicrous hype supposedly resolving dubious perceptions while impose bias discrimination prejudice perverse ideology ... must rein in, impose accountability, & imprison as deserved such devious reckless kleptocrat corporateer profiteer front facade promote exploit grift ploy ruse scam scheme; mitigation been among ruses that abscond, heist, obfuscate, externalize, transfer, impose undeserved socio-econ disparity, indulge abuse harm then obfuscate obstruct evade especially overt direct conniving bias discriminate racist promoted by ESG & DIE among else that are deliberate blatant ethical violations & immorality."
Catastrophe sounds like some kind of trophy
That scheme looks like an easy target for Bolsonaro type populists
👏👏
"I think it's a great concept to pay countries, so they protect their forests...but truth of the matter is it is really hard for such countries to ""patrol"" these big vast lands. Deforesters know this and take an advantage of this."
"Meh we live in finite resource world but hope for infinite growth, even the world end human greed will never stop. Until its time to die"
Really very dangerous for the world
"Noooo “Climate Change” is NOT caused by man, but by natural cycles in the Sun & other celestial objects. However, man IS responsible for much of the world’s deforestation."
"I don't disagree with the ideas expressed in the video, but there's a limit to how much money can be made from eco-tourism. Not every equatorial country could follow the Costa Rican model as, unfortunately, there aren't enough tourists interested in that kind of travel. Also, you should have had a few robber-barons in the segment laughing at it all as they sway right-wing opinion against it."
"We hope that Guyana follows in the footsteps of Costa Rica. With their new discovery of oil, growth might lead them into using their resources for monetary gains, instead of preservation of their pristine forest."
"Greed is causing too many of the worlds problems including climate change. As soon as we eliminate greed, most problems will disappear. Many people will need to be killed before this happens."
First step: Kick out Jair Bolsonaro. Checked!
only slavery would have save my world!
"Where is the win-win situation for the planet, when industrial countries produce as much CO2 as before and pollute the environment with their waste? They are just paying now for their absolution. It's as with the church in the middle ages."
Yes . the answer is YES
climate change gibberish... no thanks
"It can help.  Poor farmers need alternatives, so they stop burning down rain forests."
"Climate change is mans sins. This world is dead. I have no doubt that Jesus Christ is returning oh so soon.  Open your hearts to him, ask for the forgiveness of your sins, and follow him. Time is short folks"
Sharing will save the world
"Europeans invaded America,Africa and Asia..started deforestation for sugarcane,mining and shelter ..they should solve this problem"
You don'T have to turn vegan to help. Just eating less meat helps a looooooooot
Money is the problem.
"90 % carbon emition coming from developed country.
The best is, relocating industries from developed country to developing country. And reforest again all lefted land in developed country.
Equal economic, equal nature responsibility.
 Dont make developed country enjoy their welthy from their deforestation for industrialitation while developing country should take care nature and holding their industrialitation just to safe nature who destruced by developed country"
"If you eat meat and want to stop the destruction of forests you are a part of the problem not the solution, and a world class hypocrite."
"In my country, there are an increasing number of food producers moving towards regenerative sustainable environmentally friendly food production to suit the land and climate by reducing herd size and planting both native and exotic trees on marginal food producing land. Unfortunately these producers get criticism from those food producers that use land intensive production that has a lower financial return compared sustainable environmentally friendly food production."
A 5p or 10p tax on all goods and services in the UK to save the environment. That is what we need. Every country should do it!
They get paid to deforest but we don't get paid to stop them
"We should subsidize people NOT to have children (and shut down the catholic church).
That is the root cause of all this polution and climate change."
Amazing documentary. Another one. Thank you! AND so well done Costa Rica! Mind boggling results..:-))

Put the details about how much GHG was generated in production of any product.
Wait that means other countries have to cut down more trees to feed Costa Rica if Costa Rica depends more on food import. I don't think this is a win win this is zero sum.
So much garbage! Boy have I learned a lot and outgrown this nonsense. I feel sorry for people who are new to this sort of thing and believe it.
I find it honestly quite astounding that meat consumption is completely omitted in this discussion. If cattle farming is the number one reason for deforestation would it not make sense to also suggest that our western habit of meat consumtion ought to be reduced?
The Amazon is being deforested to raise cattle and grow soy to feed cattle there and around the world. Stop consuming beef and other animal products and they'll have to stop meeting that demand for profits.

"Well argumented case! Incredible to hear this sound argument from The Economist. Years ago, The Economist was one of the engines driving blind economic growth at the cost of the planet."
Carbon credit and offset is such a sham
The Economist needs to talk about Ecosia they are a search engine that plants trees
Carbon tax = Your gas bill goes up with a tax on how much you used that month (carbon tax). All businesses get the same tax IF no LOOPHOLES... They in turn raise their prices because to not eat the loss and pass it on to YOU. This is a scam against YOU. The science is not in agreement either. Don't let them lie to you. More carbon= more vegetation growth. Don't let them take more of your money and gain more power!
I am from Costa Rica. This is very shameful reality... Poor people are paying to save the rain forest in Costa Rica.There is a 100 years of oil/petroleum reserves in Costa Rica but the lefties have blocked such initiatives. The costarican elite have destroyed our economy...
Developed countries have more obligations in environmental protection.
The awareness of people  for nvestment in nature conservation is more cost effective than financial and lives lost caused by climate disasters in the world.
Global warming is increasing forests due to increased temperature and humidity
"This is what the COP26,should focused on,not the emission what they are talking about!CO2is absorbed by the trees and release it is their breathing life!"

meanwhile china planted 36 billion trees.................
I become tensed about future after seeing this 🙁
It's very sad 😢 to see how we humans causing damage to the mother Earth 🌍.

"Animal agriculture is a major cause of deforestation.  Why else should we switch to a plant based diet?
Why should each of us go vegan?  Here is a partial list.
1-Your own health (vegans are less likely to get several deadly chronic diseases)
2-Helping to end animal agriculture would reduce the chance of another pandemic & other zoonotic diseases
3-Helping to end animal ag would reduce the chance of the development of an antibiotic resistant pathogen.
4-Animal ag wastes a huge amount of fresh water.  Each vegan saves 219,000 gallons of water every year!
5-Animal ag is a major cause of water pollution
6-A plant based food system would feed a lot more people.  Our population is growing!
7-Animal ag increases PTSD and spousal abuse in the people who work in slaughterhouses.  Workers in meat packing facilities often endure terrible, dangerous working conditions. 
8-Animal ag is a major cause of the loss of habitat and biodiversity
9-Animal welfare, obviously
10- It is the single most effective way for each of us to fight climate change and environmental degradation.
11- Longer lifespan.  
12- Healthier weight (vegans were the only dietary group in the Adventist Studies that had an average BMI in the recommended range.)
13- A vegan world would save 8 million human lives a year, and $1.5 trillion in health care costs (Oxford Study)

If you doubt any of them, I would be glad to cite evidence from credible sources to back them up.  YouTube only allows a certain number of links at my channel."
"We are the result of 4 billion years of evolution; our ancestors survived in that time at least 5 almost total extinctions: we are part of an extremely COMPLEX AND SENSITIVE ecosystem.

NO SUPERTECHNOLOGY OR SUPERCITY or anything can replace these 4 billion years.

The strongest do not survive, nor do the most intelligent or technologically advanced, the species that ADAPT to their environment, to their ecosystems, survive.

I believe that climate change is SERIOUS, but I am more pessimistic, it will not be climate change (only) that will lead us to a VERY close EXTINCTION, it will be and it was, our total DISADAPTATION to the ecosystems of our Planet Earth.

Those futuristic cities are NON-scientific magical thinking or STUPIDIZATION of thinkers: NOTHING WILL REPLACE THE ECOSYSTEMS THAT EVOLVED WITH US and on which we depend, serious and unthinkable problems will always occur in our biology if we separate from them, even those that harm us or pathogens (bacteria, fungi, parasites, viruses <not living beings>, etc.).

EVERYTHING IS (WAS) A VERY COMPLEX AND IRREPLACEABLE WONDERFUL BALANCE.

It is late, there are things that can no longer be reversed. And while equally in millions or billions of millions of years we will disappear, yes or yes, it is not an excuse to justify the irreversible damage that we, human beings <HomoSapiens>, have done to the Planet in CAPITAL LETTERS OF TIME during this wonderful HOLOCENE. 

There is no solution, only to make the end as less catastrophic or painful as possible. 

<I HOPE I'M WRONG, I DEEPLY WISH I'M WRONG>."
So where are the global politicians and global organizations that have been pointing the finger at us while taking money for more deforestation? Hello McFly…..
"The postmodern human being is not ready for a consumtion-free-world. Consumtion is our everything for this human being, it's what decides hers identity, security, friendships, culture, free time. For most people in the technological societies, climate change and sustainable future is just a like button on instagram, a comment on facebook/youtube, a small protest during a day or two, but after that we all head back to consuming high ammounts of cloths, coffee, video games, sushi, make up, food. (my self included). 

The solution must be the way the modern society worked, were countries were consuming alot more of what they, themselfs produced, not feeding thire natural resources to a  never satisfied global market."
That made me cry 😿
"It is no secret that Europe has colonized most of the world, and it is by no coincidence we are now experiencing planetary degradation."

Republicans: Climate change is a hoax... Capitalism is gonna be the end of our especies. People love money & fame more than humans & nature
"Palm oil is 2nd. Let's talk about the 1st reason.... *Top reason for deforestation: Animal agriculture.* Growing food to feed animals. Especially in places like Brazil, who's payed off by Canada, UK, and USA, to create massive grain, corn, soy felids to feed Cattle. We don't need to all be vegans, but we also don't need to consume this much meat in a system that taxes rainforest acreage. That's one of the reasons lab grown meat and plant based meat (you see Beyond Meat more and more now) is on the rise."
Well actually this video is good quite good for me because nowadays having lessons on deforestation’s and GHGs and environmental impacts and also on green gas house emissions also actually mentioned before the ghgs in my school nowadays actually this was quite familiar to that so thanks a lot for the knowledge and information. 🙂.well actually more likely in the E.M. Lessons.
i wish i were never born in this century of people with dead souls and no trees .
Lies and more lies. Pure propaganda
The love of money is the root of all evil.
The only way to fix the climate is get rid of every politician in every country and multinational corporations.
"We are expecting South America to stop cutting the trees ...but what we in for example in Europe are doing to save our trees?
I live on south Poland by Czech and Slovakia border (mountains )
Each day gigant lorries transport our coniferous trees abroad to west Europe.... big companies order.... and then they find cheap place to buy..... and they buy it... because poor east Europe will sale to have money to eat..... 
the same in South America.... rich are buying from poor..... poor kill their land to survive.... 

Who is guilty? Only those who cut?
Or maybe those who pay are guilty too?

Everyone 50% we are all responsible.
We are all killing our planet like cancer ;("
"You want to prevent deforestation? Stop eating beff, and burgers. Are you still sure you REALLY want to prevent deforestation?.

Nobody does anything, everybody just posts cute comments with good intentions, like it had any effect to the real world.

Stop talking and just stop eating beef now!!!"
"Selon une nouvelle étude, la Terre a dépassé sept des huit limites de sécurité scientifiquement établies pour la vie.
Nous nous dirigeons maintenant vers ""la zone dangereuse"", non seulement pour une planète en surchauffe qui perd ses zones naturelles, mais pour le bien-être des personnes qui y vivent"
"What can each of us do about it?  Switching to a plant based diet is the single most effective way for each of us to minimize our environmental footprint.
""According to the most comprehensive analysis of farming’s impact on the planet, plant-based food is most effective at combatting climate change. Oxford University researcher Joseph Poore, who led the study, said adopting a vegan diet is “the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth.”

 “A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use.”. -Joseph Poore, Environmental Science Researcher, University of Oxford.

Joseph Poore switched to a plant based diet after seeing the results of the study.

Why did they hide the dislike count 😬
Searched about deforestation because of an essay writing competition tomorrow at school but after seeing this I feel so bad...I mean we didn't even think or was aware of it before.
We are 7 billion now heading towards 10-12 billion . Imagine condition. Please adopt 1 child policy or 0 child and go for vegan plate less meat or no meat.
Remember when scientists said that wed all be dead by 2015 because of climate change?? Its 2021...
its all for money gains
Illegal groups are cutting down the forest in Mexico where the monarch butterflies go for the winter.  We are our own worst enemy on so many levels!!
El ser humano es como una bacteria
ONLY 50K VIEWS YET THE MESSAGE IS SO IMPACTING TO ALL OF US! WHEN ARE WE EVER GOING TO WAKE UP?!
It was okay when the richer western countries threw their Forrest’s down and almost eradicated all their wildlife species but when poorer countries are trying to build their infrastructures to help their own countries its a problem.
Even though this is happening I feel like this is the powers that be fault they did this and now you want us all to take accountability but it is what it is maybe it's meant to happen if not so it wouldn't be.

"If greenhouse gases actually are the reason for why our climate is warm, and warming, then why would a 47% increase in CO2 only result in 1°C?

That's right. From 280ppm, to 414ppm, only 1°C. In other words, from 0.028% of the atmosphere, to 0.041%. That's clearly far less than 1%. It's actually about 1/25 of 1%. The actual increase over the course of the entire industrial revolution is about 0.01%, or 1/100 of 1%.

If you actually believe climate change, you are out of touch with reality, and lacking in common sense.

The problem with fossil fuels is how energy dense they are, in proportion to how much energy is actually converted into kinetic energy. A tiny amount of CO2 and H2O emissions actually result in a tremendous amount of energy, and most of it is wasted as heat, ~70%. That means 7/10 gallons of gasoline is just/only wasted heat, being pumped into the local environment.

Considering how much hotter the ground level atmosphere naturally is, because of the atmospheric pressure, and the fact that almost all the heat being wasted is around ground level, it's safe to say that it effects the ""atmosphere"" a lot.

This notion that only CO2 somehow traps heat is ludicrous. The entire atmosphere traps heat. Everytime it absorbs energy and gets hot, it ""traps"" heat. While CO2 can literally hold more energy than O2, it also takes more energy to get hot. The only time it appears to be a greenhouse gas is when you ignore the mass of the gas itself, and it's greater density causes it to build pressure within a container far more quickly.

There's a reason why cooking in the oven at 350°F doesn't cook as fast as boiling water. It's the same reason why a pot of water boils faster with the lid on. It's because of pressure.

More mass = more pressure. CO2 is a denser gas, and so it builds pressure much faster than normal air. In the environment, not only is there not enough CO2 for it to actually matter, there's no way for it to build pressure in an exclusive way (the CO2 is just as hot as everything else) because there's no lid or segregation. It's very well mixed in, constituting 0.04% of the total.

I'm sick of climate change."
there's no stopping any of it now. human extinction is baked in already.
"The greed of humanity, well actually the oligarchs who are never satisfied  and just want more and more, you own 10 houses,30 cars but you can only live in one house and drive one car at a time. If society continues at its current rate of consumption and total disregard for the environment will there be a future for future generations. When thousands of trees are being chopped down everyday, trees that take 30-50 years to fully grow, there ends up being a finite amount of these trees all for trivial items like paper towels. There has to be a change in this modern way of life, a balance and harmonization with nature or else millions of species will go extinct. SMH the future seems hopelessly bleak.May God help this world"

"Face the facts man... even if we wanted to stop this kind of stuff we can't. The problem is, if we slow down productions, economies will fail. If economies fail, then societies fall. There are literal evil tyrants in the world with nuclear bombs that can conquer everything at any given moment. So if our societies fail, these crazy countries with mass destructive weapons will simply conquer and enslave all of us. Then they'll just continue burning away all the forests, with or without our support. The sad truth is simply, we have no choice but to continue defending and surviving, even if it means our own destruction of our planet. Until we somehow can defend ourselves against these other countries, we can't stop producing and fighting for more resources. No matter what, in the end we'll all have to go to war until there's only one unified nation to control everything. The extinction of mankind and all the species is inevitable due to human nature and our survival needs."
2:56 This breaks my heart
Nothing is going to change as long as capitalism reign. So the first thing we should do is to burn down capitalism... I'm not saying that we should change to communism tho. Both are equally worst
Humanity is so stupid.
I can’t stand Deforestation I want animals to live free and in the wild
"It's ok we are net zero by 2050, we don't have to do anything. Actually we can burn more stuff because we are net zero by 2050. Lets celebrate our net zero plan by cutting down some trees!"

The tragedy of Darth deforestation the wise.
"Apropos of something, from the movie Blade Runner:

Priss:  Then we're stupid, and we'll die."
"Stop invest in Indonesia, you can't breathe"
"¶ 👁️‍🗨️ Heretical Thesis: •Maybe the  rainforest-nations just imitate now what we Westeners did for the past 200 years in out own countries already (maximise our profit and production to reach more and more wealth)   •Maybe instead of buying palm oil for our own exaggerated comfort-products we Westeners should pay every year vast amounts of money to those always critisized ""rainforest-countries"" so that they can afford the same exaggerated standards as we do and at the same time still have the money to protect the rainforest?! •Maybe we Westeners should also stop to fly every year in increasing numbers to far-away or 'close-by' destinations and instead rapidly use this workforce (of too many pilots i.e.) as well as the saved money of those dozens of flight-tickets (that where not at all compatible with our Co2-footprint) to rapidly transform our own economies: for mostly local sustainable high-quality fair-trade (&mostly vegan) food and goods. Maybe such way of relocating our investments AND our values  could help the planet for real? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Speaking of deforestation...If you ever want a perfect example of media and leftist hysteria/alarmism re climate change look at the 2019 Amazon wildfires. 
The initial headlines included:
“The Amazon is burning at ALL TIME RECORD levels!”
“Climate change leads to RECORD wildfires in the Amazon!”
“The Amazon, Earth’s lungs, are being destroyed by climate change!”

Etc etc

And of course celebrities like Leo DeCaprio we’re losing their minds and preaching to their 10s of millions of fans the record wildfires were proof of climate change. 

They were all lies by omission. 

1. The VAST majority of the fires were deliberately set for deforestation, much of it illegal. 
2. Detailed record keeping for Amazon wildfires only goes back to the early 2000s. Yep, the “All Time Record” wildfires were based on less than 20 years of data. 

I guarantee there’s still brainwashed leftists who have no idea on the facts surrounding the 2019 Amazon fires and think they were a direct result of the climate change boogeyman. 

Which is just the way the media want it."
Government is simply pushing the can down the road on such a massive challenge🌍….need to understand the severity of the major issue🌳…we all need to be proactively look forward for the solutions...many of the species are on the verge of extinction..🦇🦧🐆🐅🦒🪐animals are the beauty of jungle and they also balance the world's ecosystem..save them🙏🏻
We’re they burning Fossil fuels in Biblical times during the great Noah flood of the Bible?
They should just make a law that if you cut down a tree you get hung on one.
the monkey trying to defend the fallen trees is very very upsetting. i hope these tree killers feel the wrath of karma swiftly
This is crazy there'll be no future world humans are destroying it over money fools so sad the future children will suffer over this
"Some key information is left out about deforestation: that those soy farms largely go to feed the cattle, pigs and other animals that become meat for rich-world countries (who set the lifestyle aspirations for much of the rest of the world). That most processed foods are less nutritious and tie into diet-related health epidemics in America.

Solutions : eat food made closer to home, eat lower down the food chain, and demand products grown without conflict palm oil."
"People are so dumb and ignorant, they are a joke and deserves every thing they get, no mercy from me. I  knew this 30 years ago and nothing has changed my opinion since then."
"Climate change, how did global warming morph to climate  change? 
Has not the same news repeated in the past decades?? 

Shall we check numbers? 
Choose any search engine, yahoo, bing or G
Search for, ( earth atmosphere content , pie chrt) choose any 3 results, it will be Nitrogen 72%, Oxygen 16%, Argon 1%, is co2 missing?  CO2 an be found in trace gas section,  CO2 content is 0.048%

This trace gas is responsible for all life and all food chains on earth. Responsible for  all meats,  grains and fruits we eat. Gobal warming today is a trillion  $ industry.
All leaders have to fly first class to the first world, meet at a 7 star resort and sign a treaty and drink wine and whiskey, it only costs tax payers a few million $

Trace gas CO2 (0.048%) can only have trace effects on earth atmosphere"
All the country in all of south american continent must have a very strictly law that can protect the amazon rain forest!
"The agenda is to destroy , so many places are clear cutting here in canada , atmospheric changes , less rain , more forest fires , our society is based on waste and sickness . Only a few in charge as most are puppet,s , all consumer products will continue to cost more as your $  devalues ........ now we sit and watch what our kids will inherit . What a wonderful life .."
"Australia is the Hottest and Driest inhabited Continent, with very little Forests left.
And our Australian Governments, State and Federal, STILL want to cut as many Trees down as they can, because we keep on electing Idiots."
"Palm oil is 5x more efficient than any other vegetable oil crop. So using another crop would make things even worse, we simply need to eat. Stop bashing palm oil, eradicating this industry is not the solution..."
"People tend to only show concern when major events or personal circumstances affect them. As humans, we often prioritize our own interests and fail to extend the same level of care and concern to others. This raises the question: why is it so hard to care for others? Perhaps it's because there's no monetary reward for doing so. However, if we want to make the world a better place, we need to start caring more. Though it may be challenging, it's important to start taking action now. After all, if we don't start now, when will we?"
Your hunger for flesh is causing forests to be cut down to grow grain for animals which when we eat them kill us.   Obey Genesis 1:29.    We all need oxygen.
Trees are 32% CO2 deficient and suffering from lack. FACT. The more the greener. FACT funny there's proof the inkas had clear cut the whole area and landscaped it. And it all comes back in just a few years. Yet to these people it's something devistating and permanent. What a joke.

i will tell ya guys simply this...9 years now two student invented a device that can extinguish fires with sound...this could totally revolutionize the way we fight forest fires that could literally make the ma thing of the past...BUT! DARPA TOOK THEW PATENT FOR ARMY USE AND WE NEVER SO NOTHING 9 YEARS AFTER
I’ve travelled to 43 countries since 1972 and seen nearly everything minimized or totally destroyed. So depressing but with no way out. The world is dying.

About 80% of fossil fuels must remain in the ground. Never to be used.
"Solutions for climate change. 
You look around the world and see there are 7.5 Billion people trying to survive in this game. If everyone was given a space 3 feet by 2 feet (6 square feet), and were to stand next to each other (in their spaces, not shoulder to shoulder), they would need 45 Billion square feet of space to stand in. A 40.25 mile X 40.25 mile square space of ground contains 45.1 Billion square feet of space, more than what is needed for the whole population of the world to stand together in their spaces, enough for an additional 16,666,666 people. If they were shoulder to shoulder they would need 30% less space. This planet is sparsely populated with people. With so few people on the planet, not even being able to fill up a 40.25 mile X 40.25 mile square, taking up so little space, you wonder why there is starvation and homelessness in the world. You realize this is also the result of the monopoly game. That the world is not overpopulated, it is over-machined, intentionally, and the machine has been built large enough to need the world's population to tend it, to be its slaves.                         This is the game, you realize you must escape the game.

Grow Live Tower: A cylindrical structure that has a central support column, periphery support columns, and suspension cables/chains that connect the two to support the floor levels. This 'suspension bridge' type of construction allows for a wide diameter, flexible structure that can withstand greater seismic events. The lower 20 levels house the people, the upper 60 levels are greenhouse levels that provide more food than the building dwellers need. The Power Multiplier Devices run up and down the outside of the periphery columns to provide the energy for the levels. All electric luxury housing and greenhouse levels (humidifiers, heaters, refrigeration, lawn mower type harvesters, grow bulbs, etc..). Less than 500,000 of these GLTs would house the entire population of the United States. If the world embraced these it would mean the end of world hunger, homelessness, and global disease would be reduced by 85% due to improved living conditions. Water conservation increased by 10,000%, mankind's footprint reduced by 60%. Fossil fuel energy production eliminated.

Reforming Arctic Ice. Using sectional floatation, 20' diameter pipes would hang vertically from the ocean surface to 20' from the ocean floor, being close to the ice pack. A water pump at the top would need to just pump out the top 4' feet of water before the capillary effect would begin bringing up the colder water from the bottom. This colder water hitting the ice would reduce the amount of melt throughout the summer and allow the winter to build up a greater amount of ice every winter. One pipe would do nothing, 10,000 would have the desired effect of building up the ice and cooling the entire region, possibly helping to reduce the melting of the Greenland ice pack. Placing large numbers of these in strategic places on the continental currents would help as well. Impossibly placing millions of these spaced equally in all the world's oceans, each having it's top 10 meters below the surface, would cool the surface of all the oceans of the world. Not possible, but it would work none the less.

The Power Multiplier Device: Open sourced, carbon free, gravity driven, free energy generator: 

Power Multiplier Device, last resize (I hope)-overunity.com 

Functions as follows: 

Small motor draws energy from the battery to turn a large bicycle-type wheel clockwise, turning the drive sprocket clockwise also because both share the same axle. This has the drive sprocket climb the chain, taking the whole assembly with its 2,000 pounds of weights. Three things now happen: 

1) The motor takes the assembly to the top of the chain with its 400 pound pull, taking 1 hour to do so, requiring the energy amount from the battery. Energy Expended going up. EE/up= 1 hour pull of 400 pounds from the battery.

2) As the assembly is climbing the chain, its heavy weight (2,000 lbs.) is still hanging/pulling on the chain, pulling the chain down which turns the transmission/generator, producing a full charge of energy going back into the battery. Energy generated going up, EG/Up = 1 hour of a 2,000 pound pull by the heavy mechanism.

3) When the assembly reaches the top the small motor shuts off and the assembly's weight slowly begins to descend, pulling the chain down with it. Since it climbed the chain faster than it pulled the chain down, its descent will take longer than 1 hour for its energy generated down charge into the battery. EG/Down = 1+ hour of a 2,000 pound pull charging into the battery.

EE/Up 1 hour of a 400 pound pull < EG/UP (1 hour of a 2,000 pound pull charge into the battery) + EG/Down (1+ hours of the 2,000 pound pull charge into the battery) = FE,   EE/UP < (EG/UP + EG/Down) = FE.

With a heavier weight:

1) The motor takes the assembly to the top of the chain, taking 3 minutes to do so, requiring the energy amount from the battery that is represented by the expression 1N. Energy expended going up. EE/up=1N. 

2) As the assembly is climbing the chain, its heavy weight is still hanging/pulling on the chain, pulling the chain down which turns the transmission/generator, producing a full charge of energy going back into the battery. Energy generated going up, EG/up=.4N. 

3) When the assembly reaches the top the small motor shuts off and the assembly's weight slowly begins to descend, pulling the chain down with it. This descent takes 10 times longer than the ascent due to the heavy weight of the assembly, and the low gearing of the transmission, it 'creeps' down. 

In 3 minutes going up, .4N was charged back into the battery. In 6 minutes going down .8N will be charged into the battery, replacing all of the energy the small motor expended. The remaining 24 minutes of the descent will charge 3.2N into the battery, Energy generated going down, EG/down=3.2N energy not needed for the mechanism's operation, free energy.

EE/up < (EG/up + EG/down) = FE , or, 1N < (.4N + 4N) = 3.4N FE

Connecting another PMD having more weight to the lower sprocket of the first will produce more energy. The chain goes around the lower sprocket of the first one, and up around the bicycle type of the second, so the lower sprocket of the first one is acting like the small motor does to turn the first one’s bicycle type wheel. A swing arm is placed between the two wheels to play out more chain as the second PMD’s bicycle type wheel ascends. Then a third PMD connected to the second….

This will decentralize the grid and end regional blackouts. It will also provide energy for remote desalination plants on the coast, or local tribes."
They need to set fire to the Amazon and watch it burn
Downvoted. Came here for the Amazon not glaciers
"From now on, the “evaporation-condensation-rain” theory will no longer be taught to the world (new 2021).
Rain formation is the combustion of hydrogen in a true chemical reaction.
H₂ + ½ of O₂ → H₂O → Rain and not by condensation of water vapor resulting from evapo-transpiration which decomposes in altitude into H2 and O under the action of solar ultraviolet rays (UV) .

can you really beleive a presedent that allows logging for his own greedy pocket and killing poor natives to clear there land   now he says he will now stop logging  because they are having an election so little satan wants to look good dont trust this liar he will continue logging if he gets back in to power jesus can see through this littel saten the land belongs to the amazon people not this little murdering hitler.
"The longest tunnel in Europe is 35 miles.   Bore a tunnel 10 to 15 miles straight down through non fractured stable rock, and you have super heated steam.   Built to scale,  with turbines stacked on top of one another,  and water recycled,  a geo thermal project such as this could supply a city or more.   The issue obviously is heat,  overcoming the heat until you have an insulator installed.   Once done this,  with proper maintenance  would last centuries and be 24/7.    The other issue, is the lack of will, and the meddling of the oil companies who don't won't the competition.    My hope is someone will pass this along to some engineering firm who is up to the challenge, especially in Europe."

"I'm glad I wasn't one of the scientists down there trying to save the Amazon. I'd be more upset than I already am. They even made a sustainable economy for the people from the Amazon without destroying it. It's a real shame for us all. Strap on your seatbelt Dorothy, because Jesus is coming!"
"here I'm going to leave my comment on another video where they blamed us Brazilians as causing climate disgrace among other things, and also remembering that the richest countries are the ones that pollute the most and besides Germany and Norway that has an ""Initiative with a background"" Nobody Brazil pays more to maintain the Amazon but everyone says they need it ironic, right?"
What do you think it would take to keep global warming below 2°C?

"Take care everyone. I love you all. I hope civilization ends quickly for the sake of all of us. Because if it's slow, it won't be nice..."
"A big problem in Brazil is certainly the unhindered influx of people into the Amazon basin. All across Brazil in advertisements people are advertised to go into the Amazon where they get land for free. While the Amazon Basin was in the 1970s a place with only several hundred thousands of inhabitants, it is now an area with millions and millions of people. Where there are human beings they want to grow and have space for business and private developments. That's why, if you want the Amazon primeval forest to be saved, kick the people out in the first place. Block the Transamazonica and other big roads all across the basin. Then give the forest time and it will start to conquer back the lost millions of square kilometres by itself."
Ice that's already in the water can't raise the water level only ice that falls from land into water can raise it's level am I wrong about this
Plant a billion trees a year !
I hope you got a B+ or higher from your school teacher for that.  Have you heard of David Attenborough.
If the Amazon cannot be reforested because of human habitats and cities...nations in South Africa with deserts should forest half it and help keep South America with forests...
Protest all you want BUT humans will not stop until this planet has been laid to waste. FACT.

Save Our Planet Now
All living things evolved and will continue to evolve History has shown a pattern of the Earth going through changes dating back to billions of years ago Who’s to say this isn’t an evolutionary period &  natural selection process I’m sure Methane and CO2 don’t help our eco system I believe the process regardless is inevitable Still I’ll need do more research on the topic I’m all for saving the Rainforest and boycotting their president!
And we started into the abyss of extinction and did nothing! Humans do not deserve to exist as a species.
"more than 40,000 species of plants, 3,000 of fishes, 1,300 of birds, 427 of mammals, 427 of amphibians, 378 of reptiles and of more than 1,25,000 invertebrates. Scientists estimate that in these rain forests there might be at least two million insect species waiting to be discovered and named.

We need to have the will
"I believe we're only fixing this one way--restraint. We cannot force people to stop killing the biodiversity in the rainforest and turning the net oxygen gain from 1/3 of the worlds oxygen into centuries old churning of carbon dioxide. 

Only we can turn off the lights, vote for politicians with the will to solve it, and accept we are facing an extinction-level event, that, at best, collapses societies, fosters untreated diseases, and makes the weather--a variable in business, in culture--unpredictable. 

We must make this a national and global priority. It will take us collectively working together. To be educated. To face the hard realities the rest of this century."
"We are well over 508 ppm Co2e (2021 NOAA) which means 2,7C temperature rise if this level is kept long times. This is also backed up with elevated radiative forcing that can be measured reliably. Also noting that even a single unit added to current 1,2C leads to 1,8C. This dimming effect comes from aerosols that are produced while burning fossil fuels (main effect comes from sulphur). We have to stop producing more ghg's and then this 0,6C rushes in. So it is extremely hard to stay under 2,0C. A study in 2021 said we had 5% chance to stay below 2C... And yet still we keep on emitting on record level making ghg situation ever worse.

One thing that you missed is current trend where local forest are becoming sources of carbon. They were sinks before and now many of the forest have became a source. This is really a wide threat and has devastating impacts which in some point are already here. When the ground in many areas become a carbon source it releases its stored carbon to the atmosphere and climate will warm ever faster.

It is not very likely that we could stay under 2,0C. But yet still we has to try.

Stop burning. Stop ALL burning. Today."
meat production is the big problem that no one is willing to touch
"Since the ocean takes up almost half of our GHG emissions, wouldn't the most effective way to tackle climate change than be to give our oceans some rest and time to recover by taking out less fish? Like decreasing global fishery by 10% - how much more carbon could be taken up by the ocean and eventually carried down to the bottom for the next couple 100-1000 years?"
the world wont do anything all the time its earning money from destroying  land and people thats whats causing global warming.
this is so important and has so less fews.. Good video !
"All over the world we need “sustainable square” / “checkerboard development” 

This is where humans live in a village on 1 acre and they’re surrounded by 5 acres of protected land to care for the species.

We need to prove that there are good jobs living this way for example, there will be jobs for researchers to study the species and for tourist to come in. Observe the species and museums about the species and also there is Permaculture (growing some small scale native plants while leaving the canopy up. There can be gardening, maybe playing soccer on half court fields, and table tennis & teaching jobs - through college on site.’

It needs to happen, especially in the South American forest, but we can demonstrate it also in other countries. And plant more trees around the world  — and lots of kelp forests too!"
But look at the bright side Brazil GDP is increasing by deforestation. They could lead a awesome lifestyle.
"I feel as though the most important change we can make right now is incorporating nuclear power to replace fossil fuels, because nuclear power gives off 0 emissions and is extremely efficient. The world is simply not in a state where it can support a switch to full renewable energy on a whim, and we need nuclear power to buy us time for a transitional phase."
"For the sake of history it must be recorded that the European Commissioner Frans Timmermans and his companion Diederik Samson are responsible for the massive deforestation of the world. By spreading subsidies for wood, that market is completely disrupted. But both gentlemen seem to have no sense and persist in their support for biomass. Future generations need to know that these gentlemen are responsible. In Poland, near Bialystok, there is still an old-growth forest. Trees are hundreds of years old. They are sawn down in an hour and burned in the Vattenfall power station in Diemen in fifteen minutes. Isn't it terrible that managers with a high position apparently do not have to have common sense and can and may behave so irresponsibly."
"The presenter has not demonstrated what a Hadley cell is. Hadley sells are huge component to Global atmospheric circulation. Hadley cell walls converge over the Amazon rainforest. Hadley cells walls are accelerating away from the rainforest to creating an artificial low pressure front. This low pressure front circles the entire planet. So if you drew a line from the Amazon rainforest and Drew it around the planet, and true and L on a chalkboard and Drew a circle around it and you do that L side by side at the zero degree latitude, that is the Hadley cell walls that are leaving the tropics and are traveling outwards at 30° north and 30° South before the Hadley cell walls converge and compress the atmosphere creating an artificial high pressure front which creates deserts at that Latitude"
Only 18% ?
Amazon is net Zero as it consumes as much atmospheric gases as it produces.

"This is utter bunk. Coral reefs are thriving the world over. The Great Barrier Reef currently has a record coral cover, bursting with life. Are you talking about Earth or some other planet with oceans? The volume of the oceans is 332,519,000 cubic miles. Raising the pH by even one tenth of a pH unit, especially considering sea water's immeasurable buffering capacity, would require hundreds of thousands of cubic miles of concentrated acid. There has not been enough CO2 in the atmosphere in millions of years even to come close to causing wide-spread acidification. Try again Economist. I'm sure you have countless other hair-on-fire stories to tell of equal plausibility to inspire bogus investment."
I worked at a lime  company. Couldn’t crushed lime stone be spread in the oceans? To raise  the PH?
The irony of The Economist posting this.
Why spend BILLIONS to go to the mars when we can use it to rebuild the earth!!
"It's yet another baloney peddled by the enviro-fascist propaganda. The ocean is an active agent in balancing the atmospheric CO2 in response to solar stimulus. When the sun is more active, the ocean warms up and releases some CO2 from it's huge reservoir. This has negligible effect on the global atmospheric temperature, because the CO2 impact here is marginal, but it stimulates plant growth. The plants, especially those of boreal forests, emit various complex aerosols, which, in turn, seed clouds, which increases the albedo, and so the earth cools, whereupon the ocean absorbs back the CO2 previously emitted. In turn, the more CO2 there is in the ocean, the more phytoplankton, kelp, and other sea plants proliferate, and the more food there is for sea fauna—zooplankton, coral, fish, cetaceans, molluscs, etc. All ocean life, like continental life, is anchored in the atmospheric and oceanic  CO2. The ocean acidity varies very little in the process as the ocean life takes care of the balance. Coral reefs, for example, are known to actively adjust the acidity of the surrounding waters to their liking."
Throw a bunch of sodium hydroxide in it!
"This is because of pollution, not climate change"
"Cute that ""The Economist"" figured out that economists killed the Earth."
Another scare tactic
Yeah but also eat less fish and sea food. They are literally shrinking species from humans chomping and crunching on them. Humans will turn to marcians that even grass will be all eaten.
"Climate change is very informative. The world is unaware that the acids and carbon in the ocean destroy aquatic life, which has an impact on the food chain. We need to hear more stories like this. Bravo for this video's superb reporting."

"Get out of the Pacific and stop nuclearizing the waters with nuclear fuel, weapons, submarines, and Fukushima."
"This is not true. I've been a scuba diver for more than 30 years and the reefs are doing better now than they were 15 years ago.  And during the Cambrian explosion, which was the largest explosion of ocean life on the planet, carbon dioxide levels were 400 times higher than they are now."
"As to contributing sources of carbon dioxide, many of us are angry and disgusted with corporations and governments  for their lies that cars are the main cause. The truth is that stationaly pollutersare the main source yet continue to get away with it while we drivers are constantly attacked."
"The lower the pH value, the higher the acidity of a liquid. Solutions with low pH are acidic and solutions with high pH are basic (also known as alkaline). Prior to the Industrial Revolution, average ocean pH was about 8.2. Today, average ocean pH is about 8.1.
pH is a measure of how acidic/basic water is. The range goes from 0 - 14, with 7 being neutral. pHs of less than 7 indicate acidity, whereas a pH of greater than 7 indicates a base.
Based by this science and a wee bit of simple mathematics  (Now, I know most of you in the USA will fail to understand this simple mathematical formula as your school test scores reveal),  shows that at the current rate, oceans will become acidic by the year 3400. Well past that date if indeed, the polar ice melts."

Klimate kult wasn't happy with just global warming?
Wow……. The whole body of the ocean could become highly acidic. That is so depressing
"If you thought acidification meant the ocean was acidic, you just might be a _________."
I appreciate the work that went into producing this. It's absolutely viral to drive the urgency of this problem to the public.
Another scam
Let’s just get rid of humans…. Just kidding… mostly.
"i dont like the ""it's not climate change"" approach when it in fact, is. ocean acidification caused by higher levels of co2 is directly linked to the burning of fossil fuels."

"Estamos a destruir o ciclo da água, a destruir o que se liga à agua...e o ciclo da vida?!! Os derrames de petróleo só?! E os barris com resíduos altamente perigosos que estão no fundo do mar?! Os oceanos são como um a panela de pressão ...a esta altura já as gorduras se dissolvem na água e quando se dissolver em todas ...a vida não será possível, pois não os processos vitais de a água quebrar as ligações químicas de compostos e separar...E como deitar detergente na a água e ver como as moléculas reagem!! É um problema acidificante e não só é urgente?! Excelente análise e vídeo ..."

"Saying ocean acidification is climate change's evil twin reminds me of how team four star made Guru, Lord Slug's evil side."
"The ocean is protecting the atmosphere from warming and excessive carbon dioxide. The warming is also preventing oxygen from dissolving into the water. Unfortunately, it's also killing ocean life, and it will take a very long time for it to recover. Studied this while getting a degree in environmental engineering."
Heartbreaking... watch so you can help your children and their children 🙏
"Fun fact, we need to reverse CO2 emissions and not just reduce.  Reduction is already an impossible task....we are doomed."
"..So, when, between about 15,000 and about 6,000 years ago, sea levels rose by about 130 meters, how did that effect ocean acidification?, did we see a great dying among marine species?..No, because expanding oceans due to a warming of the environment dilute carbon.."

"Here's What they don't tell you.
Only a tiny fraction of dissolved CO2 contributes to ""carbonic acid"" formation.  There are plants colloquially called seeweed that use CO2."
CO2 +h20= carbonic acid+ocean= ocean acidification

Co2 can be converted into Graphene. We have the solution.
"Hmmm
Polar caps contain fresh water,
Maybe they are supposed to be melting."
"In many cases, I would be of the opinion that technology can be used to solve a problem. But when it comes to capturing the CO2 emissions that are already out there, I really think all these different ideas/projects going on now is just not right. They are not a reasonable solution, we cannot have millions of units maintained to deal with just what we had already. This is really, like inventing the wheel when it already exist! Instead, helping nature to recover and to grow more to capture this for us is absolutely the way to go."

The ocean is alkalynic. If it's ph moves towards the acidic side that just makes it less strong on the alkalynic side. Please get your science right before publishing nonsense like this.

"I'm puzzled as to the inclusion of Heimdal in the video. Or, perhaps with a little more generosity and less skepticism, why Climeworks (direct air carbon capture) was not. Without further information it's hard to envision either as more than tech-saviourist, wishful thinking.

Up to that point, I thought the video was well done."

"It sounds like we have no idea for sure why exactly sea creatures are disappearing due to a lack of research. It's hard, as a land dwelling human, to care about what happens under the ocean but I feel like we need to put a little more importance on studying what covers three quarters of our planet, since our survival depends on being part of a functional ecosystem. Thank you to the people responsible for this report, and to all those studying our oceans."
"For the last three years the planet has cooled. Down 0.04c last year. Antartica recorded the lowest temperatures ever seen this Winter. Lowest Temperatures ever recorded in America, a minus 109f windchill. The Grand Solar Minimum is starting to bite. It's going to get colder for at least 30 to 40 years."
Glad to know were destorying everything that gives us our atmosphere and breatheable air
"What alarmingly poor scientific thinking!  Why did the Natural History Museum study not factor in samples of shells from before the Industrial Revolution? Every reasonable scientist would have asked if ocean acidification and thinning shells might have started before the industrial revolution. Clearly, such a comparison is needed before a conclusion is attempted. After all, only some of 70% of ancient shell samples, from a limited area, showed thinned shells."

"You wouldn't know it from this ludicrous bit of scaremongering by the Economist, but the oceans are actually quite alkaline (pH 8.2-8.5). Any ""acidification"" would merely reduce the alkalinity slightly. Furthermore, sea water is strongly buffered against pH changes by ions such as hydrogencarbonate and silicate.

Did the makers of this program not know that shelled molluscs can live in fresh water (pH 8 or below)?"
We need more of these videos. Insight into a world a lot of us don't know.
"""If the world were to end all meat and dairy production and transition to a plant-based food system over the next 15 years, it would prevent enough greenhouse gas emissions to effectively cancel out emissions from all other economic sectors for the next 30 to 50 years.
That’s according to new research published today in the journal PLOS Climate. The paper’s authors say such a shift would “substantially alter the trajectory of global warming,” as animal agriculture is estimated to account for around 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.""-Vox (Title etc, follows-
""This is how much meat and dairy hurt the climate""

"Acidification over the last 400 million years did not stop ocean life from creating all the carbonates we see today.  I might also add that the ocean has absorbed all the CO2 that used to be in our atmosphere and if CO2 levels drop to 200 PPM, life of land will stop.  Everything dies and another ice age will commense."
One more tipping point to fly by in our Dodge Ram.
"This implies the incoming extinction of humankind, Higher acidity of the ocean leads to the destruction of the corals and the destruction of the corals leads to the destruction of the fish kingdom which is our great source of food, the death of the corals means the death of humankind due to starvation."
Thank you London's Natural History Museum.
No profits on a dead world.
Can we just dump pH up into the oceans?
"If 97% of CO2 is produced naturally, most of it from the oceans, what caused the biggest explosion of life when CO2 was 6000 times higher? 
There will always be variations in what the ocean produces, and perhaps is mainly down to mankind taking more than we need, which gradually reduces the quality of catches. 
Check history when the medieval warm period enabled the Danes to settle in Greenland. It was much warmer then, and CO2 was much lower. Lots of historical contradictions to todays narrative."
What about these committees impact in Alaska that killing all type of animals for consumption and exportation?
"Fun fact.  All rain, especially during thunderstorms, is acid rain.  Sure, some CO2 might contribute, but it's mostly nitrous and nitric acid.  Lightning fixes nitrogen oxides naturally and these when dissolved in water make acid."
Americans love drinking CO2-acidified drinks!!  Coke has phosphoric acid too!!

Enjoy this short video about climate change! I'll heart any comment if you can prove you watched the whole thing 🤓
Does this Video support the Climate Racketeering.
I think a lot of scientist Today would have been better Video Game Players if they had just stuck to it.
Volcanoes and forest fire doesn't kill the whole planet unless your in the year 536 or 1816.
"There is No excessive energy, that is the Scam, were does all the heat from Forest fires Go, nothing but Volcanoes can match a Forest Fires output."
"Extreme weather pattern Theories are true, Its Colder than its ever been in Tahoe, science says so."
"I saw a video of people helplessly stuck in Tahoe after they were told the weather is bad, Reality of getting stuck didnt deter 1000s from going. MUST BE REALY COLD IN CALIFORNIA."
"The Bad thing about science is it leads people to think they experienced the worst storms or worst heat in history but they were only born 18 years ago and havent seen 60 years or more of patterns that come and go, worst in history statements are never true in modern day. The bible laid claim to the worst storm in History, who wants to challenge this account of events."

"As a retired Chemical Engr I absolutely love the topic. For years, I have been asking the question. Where is the scientific/empirical evidence that validates the claim that an approx 1.5 parts per 10,000 parts increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations spread out over100 years or so is the predominant driver of ""climate change"" and all associated calamities. I am very familiar with the IPCC publications on the topic, but that info is lacking. Just asking the question."
"In a Greenhouse the Air doesn't circulate. Open the door and it gets cold at night, get it? Cold."
If rain condenses upon contact with Particles and snow freezes particles then the Billions of Tons of Coal particles must get washed out of the Air constantly.
Human population is the reason dinosaur juice is being converted to CO2.  The world population growth is doubling its size at an alarming rate.  Perhaps population growth is the real risk to the planet.

"Total nonsense.  There is no way to know if climate change is occurring.  There is no way of knowing if it was caused by humans.  Last, there is no way that the silly climate change gestures put forth by politicians and green opportunists would have any effect on a circumstance we don't understand."
Carbon is life and planet is equipped to handle CO2 produced by us. Study from 2022 show that trees are 20-30% bigger than 30 years ago also oceans are getting bigger phytoplankton blooms and thats means more food for sea life which meas more fishes in oceans... Also our crop harvests are bigger because of more CO2 so we can feed more people... Buy an aquarium and try aqua scape without CO2 and with CO2. CO2 is awesome!! Pollution and plastic waste is real problem causing real harm right now.

Climate Change is a Blatant Money Pit and half the poplultion agrees 100%."
"CO2 is good for you, burn more fuel and make the earth green again! Go green!"
"Keep in mind that Heat is always temporary, heat escapes as the earth turns, its only hot on the Sunny side of the Universe."
"I hear that the first theory of human impact was Global Cooling, those scammers must have thought that would be more believable than Global Warming."
"Climate change acceptance can’t be denial, acknowledgement of human contribution isn’t denial. However if we ask how much is natural or suggest it isn’t 100% human driven we are labeled deniers! If you want a label try realists, climate change is very real, the true cause is not clear, acceptance, adaption and survival would be a better direction, rather than trying to tax a planetary eco system into change. 
However, many of the industries that contribute to climate pollution, including human waste have to be addressed immediately, there are only limited natural resources, the waste is killing all of us."
"Keep in mind that Heat is always temporary, it always escapes into the dark outer space and leaves us ice, its an open door to heat from solor activity."
"6:07 Explain how greenhouse gases absorb the radiation because as of my knowledge Greenhouse gases absorbing infrared radiation have never been shown by experiment to cause any significant increase in air temperature. According to a 2017 paper, a simple experiment showed that air with more than 23 times the normal concentration of CO2 only warms slightly more than normal air when absorbing infrared radiation. Another problem I see is that the radiation that bounces back to Earth raises the temperature of Earth but Earth Cannot Be Warmed by Its Own Radiation, no body of matter can be warmed in any way by absorbing its own radiation. please explain these parts thanks."
"You did not prove that freezing has stopped, this means the system still works as we expect, collecting numbers on variability is a Roulette game."
"Malankavich is a gravity/electrostatic theory which has no influence on Gasses, gravity can only affect liquids not gasses."
Climate scientist Judith Curry did a great explanation as to why so many scientists or so-called scientists have to say that there's a climate crisis.   If they don't agree with those pushing the green agenda they don't get funding that includes NASA and NOAA for both been caught messing with the numbers. Auto is only supplied 2% of greenhouse gases. Volcanic cycles change the temperature and we've been in one for the last couple of years. The Earth has had extreme heat and extreme cold worse than what they've been saying.  Some of the worst floods in California occurred in the 1800s long before the industrial revolution. The biggest lie is that we should get rid of all carbon dioxide. That is what plants and the ecosystem depend on. Those that are pushing this know that the more they get rid of carbon famine will occur. And the earth is fully capable of cleaning itself which has been proven also.
Keep in Mind that heat is temporary and escapes every night.
"A greenhouse gets very cold with an open door, the Earth has an open door for heat every night, just remember that heating is always temporary."
"This video is cute and all but its a false fabrication of facts or Half Truth. you cant stop freezing temperatures as climate changers suggest, Volcanos in Equador have Snow 365 days a year and this wont stop due to Elevation. A greenhouse gets very cold with an open door, the Earth has an open door for heat every night, just remember that heating is always temporary."
Average Global Temperature is nothing but a Roulette Game.
If your poor then you only get one chance in life but if your Biden or Putin your chances are unlimited.
"Chimborazo is a place in Equador that freezes, this means even the hottest places on earth have snow because of Elevation. Cayambe in Equador has snow 365 days a year."
"In my imagination an ice age would cause a faster rotation because of angular momentum, I also imagine a sudden change in rotation speed would easily upset tectonic plates and cause world wide earthquakes of epic porportions."
Natural processes are working and will always keep working unless the earth stops rotating.
"It Seems to me that unless you can prove that Snow doesn't fall anymore then you haven't proven any kind of warming, I'm going to venture to say that Snow cannot be stopped ever due to Elevation, Volcanoes and Night Time Cooling Temperatures."
"We keep hearing bllsht about a changing climate that threatens us, climate has always been a threat to life on earth, the danger cannot be mitigated."
"or the people who say:  it was really cold the other day, so much for global warming…"
"San Francisco Bay saw Two consecutive nights of freezing frosted temperatures and now we expect 51 overnight in just one day 10 degree spike, that is how unpredictable temperature is."
Whoever burns the most fuel has the most prestige.
get your booster
You can talk about all this Heating that people are doing or God forbid Forest Fires heating everything but one thing that never ever changes is that Night time Cooling faze.
My car windows froze again this morning in the San Francisco Bay Global Warming Crisis.
Glaciers might be having a drought like California but I don't think the freezing has stopped so life goes on.
"Global cooling cannot be reduced by any measurement, Night time freezing cannot be reduced by any extent, Natural Forces cannot be reduced by any extent, Snow cannot be stopped by any extent. Hurricanes and earthquakes cannot be stopped by any extent."
"if, If! Global warming turns out to be a hoax and just news cycle political banter, i’ll never trust news ever again lol"
"The Earth has a +- 15 degree C temperature range over a 100,000 year cycle which repeats.   Reducing CO2 can only reduce temps .4 C of a degree.  The limit is 150 ppm CO2.  At this limit, all life on Earth goes extinct.  Google it yourself.

There is no climate problem.  We have to adapt to the normal temp variations.  We have no choice.  This temp variation is due to the orbit of the Earth.  See Malankovich cycles."
this was lovely.. and horrifying. thank you!
How do Lakes still freeze during a global warming crisis.
Check out All that Global Warming in Lake Tahoe FIS Ski World Cup Feb 23-24.
"It Seems to me that unless you can prove that Snow doesn't fall anymore then you haven't proven any kind of warming, I'm going to venture to say that Snow cannot be stopped ever due to Elevation, Volcanoes and Night Time Cooling Temperatures."
I wonder when Global Warming is suppose to stop the Snow from falling.
At what point in global warming do freezing temperatures stop because 7.5 ft of Snow at Kirkwood ski resort says freezing but it's a Global warming crisis right? Ski resorts should be bankrupt.
"The strangest thing about a Global Warming Crisis is that Lake Tahoe Ski resorts still sell tickets to them Icy Slopes, when do ski resorts go bankrupt for Global warming crisis."
Since when is it  that global warming causes snow and frozen car windows on february 27.
"Speed and Scale of Warming has not Happened, Car windows still freeze in the Morning."
"My Car windows were Icy this morning February 27 in the San Franicisco Bay, where is the Dam warming I keep hearing about. Everyone was ignorant once, so why is it still freezing?"
"""You're and educator"" but yet .... your facts are wrong and is nothing more than prapaganda."
I bet you had 6 jabs and boosters
"Hi, Folks.
This gentleman keeps prattling on about the 'greenhouse effect'. O.K., let'z examine what a greenhouse does and how it does it.

Greenhouses typically create a sheltered environment for the growing of plants, sometimes kept warmer than the outside ambient temperature, especially in colder climates and times and not uncommonly fed extra CO2 to encourage plant growth 'coz plants LURRRRVE CO2 which they use as a food source. They also use sunlight to help them convert CO2 into the material with which they grow and ultimately FLOURISH.

So what might happen if the Earth's atmospheric CO2 level went up a notch or two???????

Might there not be a BURST of extra vegetation to feed on the extra CO2 and grow and flourish and produce even more plants???????

NASA's own satellite photos show that this has 'ackshully' BEEN happening since the 1990s and early 2000s with the planet being around 20% greener now than it was back then.

For the rest of the alarmist predictions about the ALLEGED climate change, there are sites on the 'net listing anywhere from 50 to 120 years of FAILED apocalyptic climate change predictions. You Tube doesn't like me posting links here - might lead somebody to some information that YT doesn't like - but do your own research.

The 7,000 polar bears that were around in 2007 apparently didn't get Al Gore's memo that they would be EXTINCT by about 2013 due to the loss of Arctic sea ice and there only about 30,000 of 'em now.

I'm NOT saying that we don't need to concern ourselves about the climate. We DO. But let'z leave the alarmism and the paranoia out of it. 

Just a part of my 0.02.

You all have a wonderful day. Best wishes. Deas Plant.."
"""Stay positive"""
"I'd say if you don't like the phrase ""climate changes naturally"" then blame your scientists. They use a phrase like ""climate change"" in the first place, which is so vague and open-ended it could refer to any combination of man-made and natural climate variability.....I'd say the scientists collectively walked right into that one because Scientists opened the door to that kind of criticism for reasons just stated. If you don't like it, then use language that is more specific...."
Turning climate change into a political debate is probably one of the smartest things the oil corporations have ever done. It's really working out for them
"Climate warming is as close to a scientific fact as humanly possible. The claim that the disadvantages of human CO2 production outweigh the benefits is not a scientific fact. It’s entirely possible that that’s the case, but we simply don’t know. Because only the disadvantages are studied thoroughly. It’s like measuring a house‘s height with sophisticated equipment to the tenth of the millimeter, not measuring the height of a second house at all, and then claiming that the first house is higher than the second one. In truth just our understanding of the height of the first house and of the disadvantages of climate warming is much better than our understanding of the second house’s height and the advantages of climate warming. Maybe because nobody is paying for researching it?"
"Well, the man made climate warming has prevented the ice age that would be happening naturally. I call that a win."
"I see the whole angered by the claim part but when are we going to include people in the nature diagram,like maybe our definition of natural processes is the most basic,if a squirrel burying a nut is a natural process why aren’t our actions considered natural even though we (a natural occurrence) are doing a thing we are capable of,now I do understand that the example I gave is wildly different but I guess I’m trying to say is we could be a part of the climate cycle,the same way different things were added to it by asteroids but we are a constant input asteroids are not so much,I don’t know how to properly ask or say what I’m trying to right now"
"The problem is many people who want to deny climate change, deny it because they don’t want to listen. When a weatherman goes on television and gives the forecast for the next week people listen people pay attention. If they tell you it’s going to rain tomorrow people get umbrellas.  The same people who listen to the weatherman, won’t listen to the scientist that say climate changes real, even though they often are one and the same.

We faced the same thing with COVID-19. The same doctors that helped fight disease all across the globe they said hey guys, it’s a pandemic let’s take some corrective action so people won’t die. Someone said all right you’re the expert I’ll take you at your word others who never studied medicine or biology or chemistry said you have no idea what you’re talking about. The same people if they went into a doctors office to discuss diabetes or high blood pressure or heart disease would listen to the doctor then, but they won’t listen to the doctor when it comes to COVID-19. It’s literally because people don’t want to listen to something it goes against what they have determined to be true without any knowledge to back up their claim.  In fact, in many cases, people determine what they want to be true because of politics, especially in America. This Hass to be true, because my politician said so never mind the expert."
"Well and there you go. After a good start and quite informative 25 min and 43 sec we all get it. The planet will be unlivable for our children and grandchildren. That is a lie. Plain and simple. You are all the time saying the science knows so much. Well we also know that the temperature has been warmer than today. I live in Norway. The climate was so much warmer that trees were growing higher up in the mountains than today. The mountain range of Dovre, Hardanger and Valdresflyen was all covered by forest which is not the case today. This was around 4000 years ago. That,s why there are no glaziers in Norway from the last ice age. They all melted during that warm period."
"I've been arguing lately that because natural climate changes happen, from a certain perspective we'd better hope that we're having an impact. I know that it was unplanned and incredibly dangerous, but we were going to have to tinker with the climate eventually. And for the heads in the sand people that think that the earth is too big for humans to effect, I'd offer a syringe of Ebola since the size difference of a virus when compared to a human is twice the size difference when comparing a human to the earth."
everything is natural with the exception of the supernatural!
The biggest source of unnecessary CO2 emissions is created by the yapping of shills concerning imaginary and political climate change.

"Rather than listening to ordinary folks (including school teachers, sadly!) who may or may not know quite as much about the science as they need to, I suggest having a listen to people at the top of their profession, such as ...

"It's both a natural cycle, and current human technology affects it. How much is the question. Global cooling is a far worse threat to life on Earth."
Lake Tahoe still making Snow just like we Expect.
Without providing any evidence this man is just trying to shame people with opposite approach or thoughts. That's not rational rather it's trying to oppress the critical thinking.
"The name ‘Climate Change’ doesn’t help, people associate it with natural variability, hence this video to correct the misunderstanding. What if we called it ‘Climate Disruption’, or the good ol’ ‘Global Warming’."
Ideal gas laws prove CO2 does not cause global warming... so do tree rings and ice core records.
"When the climate models don´t fit with the data (untampered data), just adjust the data and you get more fundings."
"I need someone to explain how Kirkwood Ski Resort achieved 7.5 ft snow base/solid packed snow this year from 228 inches of fresh powder snow measurments during a Global warming crisis, nothing seems to have changed for Tahoe ski resorts, don't they breath the same air as we do meaning the Coriolis affect, the numbers just don't add up."
"The climate is warming, I agree and it wouldn't hurt to find ways to remove CO2 from the upper atmosphere. And whose going to complain when they've sucked out too much and we then entered into an ice age. Let me know how that works out SKIPPY."
"The ocean have been bubbling up Methane for decades. Nobody ever accounts for this. It's huge. You know what? Why not concentrate on cleaning up the planet's surface and waterways and oceans. It's a good start. Lobby your government to lift the National Security Act as an excuse to thwart proper progress for Over Unity, Free Energy, Zero Point. Then I can see being real serious about moving on from fissile fuels. If the planet does'nt do a flip first."

"It's interesting that the sahara dessert was recently found to emit sand into the upper atmosphere, yet we're told that refrigerants, volcanoes, and even fungi contribute to chlorine in the upper atmosphere, but sea foam ? Nope not a bit, illegal immigrants must have taken the plane ticket along with heavier sand taking a front seat. Or maybe address the ultra white paint which has recently been proven to reflect heat energy to outer space.  Yeah, were done being lied to.  Chlorine is natural, and it's very unscientific to say otherwise unless you have first hand scientific evidence, like that kid who did the experiment myth busters.... But you really didn't do your research huh? Just rehashed other crap you read on the Internet paid for by large companies and then empowered their cronies as the climate police"

arnold is as phony as fuck.
Nuclear power now!
"It's climate changing, not climate change. 0.04% CO2. If its lower we gonna lose our green Earth. We need more CO2."
cilmate change is fake anyways  just another excuse scare tactic to tax people and farmers  your cows burp?   introducing the cow burp tax!
Wish this guy was the Republican frontrunner for President for 2024...
Thats what i like about arnold no  bullcrap like he said when people are dead their dead
"He's a great guy, and a phenomenal example of a decent politician. To my mind however, the wrong stance has always been approaching sustainability from a climate change perspective and we need to think more about resource security. I don't think co2 is likely to lead to climate change (though burning fossil fuels may harm the atmosphere in all sorts of ways). I think the bigger problem is situations such as the war in Ukraine where we now have nuclear-armed nations fighting over natural resources. Of course, sustainability will decrease our carbon footprint (if done right), and it can be good for the environment so long as we're not cutting down rainforests for soy and palm oil. We need large-scale hemp agriculture, not for carbon sequestration necessarily (though it would sequester huge amounts of co2), but for resource security and an end to the threat of nuclear war."
he loves beef 😂
All the meat he as eaten in his life
"arnold don,t say nothing about what about  the nuclear factories, the nuclear plants, and more,  don,t say nothing about the chemtrails,  the HAARPP  ,    BECAUSE    ARONLD is a puppet from liders,"
So why is everyone leaving that place ?
You or we could or stop a freaking snowstorm or a monsoon rainstorm or any other weather related event. It’s a sad reality that some rich people have come up with an idea to make us believe fossil fuels aren’t fuels that keeps industry and energy abundant for a wealthier worldwide society of healthy individuals. It’s called jealousy and envy not love for the environment which is being strangled without sufficient amounts of Co2 to sustain the oceans and forests causing less oxygen in the atmosphere than normal levels due to the lack of carbon dioxide deposited into the atmosphere.
But isnt it this capitalist system that propagates the lies that is real the problem here? Its not called the grift society for nothing.
I really used to look up to Arnold. Then I found out his muscles came from steroids. Then I found out he was a fake conservative. Then I found out he cheated with his maid and had a son after marrying into one of the most powerful political dynasties in modern history. Now climate change. What a loser.
Climate change is bs.
Aaah….. let’s terminate pollution yaa…..
"I prefer to get my info on climate science from climate scientists, not has-been actors. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJv1IPNZQao&t=20s"
lost all respect for him when he pushed the Jab.
It is not driven by people or CO2.
"There is one question that is never addressed that would expose the ""climate crisis"" for the scam that it is, which is ""What percentage of the atmosphere is CO2?"" The answer, never given in plain language, is that CO2 is currently around 420 parts per million, (google it) increased, they tell us, from 280 ppm in 1850. That's a difference of 140 ppm, or in terms more readily understood by the layman, the composition of the atmosphere has changed by 0.014% (14 thousandths of 1%) in the last 170 years. LESS THAN 1 THOUSANDTH OF 1% PER DECADE! How much closer to ""zero"" do they think it's possible to get? How gullible do you have to be to believe that this rate of change is causing extreme weather events, which have always happened and always will? Their claim is that this tiny amount ""traps heat"". ALL gasses dissipate heat and even if CO2 is an exception, the suggestion that a total of 0.042% can overwhelm the capacity of the remaining 99.958% to dissipate that heat is abject nonsense. CO2 DOES NOT control the global temperature, there is no ""climate crisis"". Wind farms, solar panels, heat pumps, EV's.. None of these measures are necessary, nor will they have the slightest effect on the weather. Eye-watering sums of money have already been wasted on this futile exercise. Time to wake up, stop throwing our money at these boondoggles and squandering the world's resources on projects that cannot possibly succeed as there never was a problem to begin with. There is no need to save the planet from a minuscule increase in the gas on which all life depends, but it does need to be rescued from idiot politicians and media mouthpieces that push this garbage."
Y los Políticos pueden vaiajar en su avión q no contaminan eh? Hay q ser hipócrita
Driving a massive big hummer is going in the right direction Arnold😮😮😮😮 screw you Arnold😊
"All other gases in the atmosphere except Oxygen 21% and Nitrogen 78% are l % or less. CO2 is .04%. If it drops below .02% all plant life could not exist. Plants do better at .10%, some greenhouse’s pump in  CO2 to increase their harvest up to .12%
This is one topic anyone can ask their cellphone. Try it, just ask how much CO2 is in the atmosphere.
That’s how uninformed most people are today."
"Same absolute waste of a human being that said ""FUCK YOUR FREEDOMS"", I have zero respect nor do I care about anything he has to say."
So riddle me this Dr Freeze.... Why don't environmentally minded people focus on these two things - nuclear energy and economic development for developing nations that are energy starved?
What a moron. Only speaking what the elite want to hear
All this nonsense about pollution when actually it does the opposite by blocking out the sun. If anything causes global warming it is all the wildfires in California and elsewhere. Back a few years ago here in Texas we had a hot winter and we also had a lot of fires all around out of control. It doesn't take rocket science to figure out that wildfires causes warming. That is only common sense but then not many have that anymore. They always want to blame things on fictional problems.
Isnt this guy a raging conservative 💩💩
Oh thats f....g convenient America... ignore the oil industry and focus on polluters rightttttttt
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Arnold bought the fanatical climate liars.
"Urban green spaces, ranging from parks to rooftop gardens, contribute significantly to climate resilience, mitigating heat island effects, absorbing carbon dioxide, and providing essential habitat for biodiversity within densely populated urban areas."
Caling CO2 a politant shows a total lack of understanding.
"You're only numbe 1 due to population. Whats the figures for GDP per capita? Also being one of the most taxed states in the union, wouldnt it also show that renewables is ok if you can afford it but if you cant you need to move out of California"

He is still living in his own movie...
Yea let’s all listen to the body builder
Ofcourse his position is sponsored by elites. Follow the money.
I think all of those muscles have migrated to his head. Climate change is a religion. Legitimate science has not been conducted.
"AS is a liar. energy costs 100% more, we have running blackouts. everytime the wind blows they shut the power off to the sierra’s. Our economy is driven by agriculture and silicon valley, the green screwed deal has cost us 100,000s of jobs, we have the most homelessness in the nation. our governor and legislature is the most corrupt in he nation. Our fires are caused because of neglect not the weather.

“The environmentalists mean well” - A famous quote by an environmentalist republican robot
"Of course they are all are lying. Its the oil lobbyist. Biggest industry in the world bringing mankind to its end.

Also its more costly to change, and in a capitalistic world where costs matters it's a no win situation. 

In essence capitalism will end us."
there's no climate change
"What a dose of unmitigated crap - has this guy seen what has happened to the countries who embraced the 'we have to go 0 net emissions and 100% sustainable energy' hoax?  collapsed economies, failure of the food production and energy systems, and in developing countries, a doubling of the infant mortality rate, and it hasn't made the slightest difference to the climate, which is determined by solar cycles, as it always has been. The proponents of global warming alarmism are all residents of La-La Land who wouldn't recognise scientific data on the climate if it bit them on the ass."
Government is controlling the weather.
"Drought in the Amazon basin! At this point in the championship, the plants built on the Madeira River were transformed into two half-loaded piles of waste.

Yet another puppet.
"The only ""climate problem"" in my opinion is all the litter us humans leave behind, the numbers for climate change dont make sence its a money making scam id 100% support climate change if it was just picking up after your self not forcing humanity to go electric and brainwashe us"
The fact that weather would change regardless of our existance on the planet is a discussion no leader is prepared to have.
Screw your pollution!!
Isn't this guy a part of the globalist cult? Good actor but.....
"Arnie is right Climate change is a lie Iv just done the maths 
37.12 billion tonnes of co2 emissions per year world wide 
1 tree absorbs 21 kgs of co2 
There are 3 trillion trees on earth give or take 
So that’s 63 trillion kgs or 630 billion tonnes 🧐so the trees are removing all the  co2 never mind the grass and other shit"
You will have nothing and be happy....except you and your friends eh Arnie?
If you have been Terminated. YOU ARE TERMINATED. We all need to chill . I’m happy with a tree house by a river if someone helps me build it on private land 😂
"So he stopped being a fascist about covid jabs, and hopped on the eco doom cult instead. Lousy actor..."
YEAHHH!!!!
"to became a something really need to have balls,good one sir"
"Having retired from a several decade career in environmental management - Arnold is right on the mark. Climate doomers are not helpful, nor vegans. Balance is needed, not hyperbolic ’data and predictions’. Nice to hear some logic for a change."
"How many people say global warming is real if there is no money in it? If no deductibles on your taxes? 
Does Arnold not realize how big the world is? Does he not read the Bible & not know something greater than us is controlling the climate? How did we get out of the ice age?"
How are we the best job creator when you go green?
"Shipping goods across the world by boat is suprisingly efficient. Although the a lot of the boats have huge emissions today, that could easily be changed. The biggest problems we should be solving are decarbonizing the grid and cutting back on meat consumption to reduce the land that we use."
We've experienced much less pollution in America for quite a few years simply because there is so little industry in our country anymore. The climate fluctuates and the situation is magnified by globalists as well.
Look how fast we changed our world for COVID. It was practically overnight. We could make this change easily. Is no one else noticing the tint/tinge of the sun!? It once was white. And there were sunny days that weren't also sweltering.

"What a 'Take the shot or die lunatic'. Piss off has been narcissist.

The totally incoherent AGW hypothesis was dead on arrival as pseudo-scientific computer generated rubbish. How can CO2 be a pollutant when 97% percent of atmospheric CO2 in naturally occurring?  Taxing the estimated 3% due to human activity won't change the weather to alarmist's liking, it will only  feed the greed machine. Where there are troughs there are pigs.

Scientist have known since the early 1900s that the warming effect of each molecule of CO2 decreases logarithmically as the concentration increases, which is why there has been only 1.0 C warming since the Little Ice Age. Meanwhile the planet is greening and the ice didn't vanish.

After decades of profit and power hungry CO2 alarmists crying wolf for so long with nothing to show for it, they now have no more credibility than the 'Safe and Effective' cult.

By the way, a lot of ‘green’ living is awfully detrimental to the environment. True scientists are flabbergasted."
Comment
"The key to understand CO2’s roles in global warming is to understand how the earth’s surface heat is transferred through the atmosphere and ultimately been emitted to the outer space. IPCC and the mainstream media have assumed this heat is emitted in the form of ir radiation by the surface, so co2 in the atmosphere would play a decisive role to capture this radiation and keep the planet warm. In fact the atmosphere would get the heat from earth’s surface through conduction, convection and water evaporation! Co2 would be the same as all other atmospheric molecules in capturing this non- radiative heat! It’s the atmosphere that provides earth’s greenhouse effect, not the trace CO2"
wow this guy's eyebrows go AROUND the eyes... impressive
im sure WSJ and CNBC can do a better explanation
"Wow, humans can change Earth's climate cycles more than volcanic activity and solar cycles combined? Problem solved once AI controls human's population. 😢"

"dear economist team, can you please look into and add Regenerative agriculture and holistic land management to the list. modern industrialized agriculture has been causing massive damage not only to carbon cycle but also in soil degradation and loss of diverse habitat which over time has massive negative consequences. Soil more than anything els is the biggest carbon sequestration footprint, if only we let and intensive soil do it and keep it in the soil. not only that, carbon heavy soil is a richer much more productive soil. so much to talk on this subject. comment section is not enough to explain the complexity and massive potential and need of moving to regenerative ag. please do further research on this. I am subsirber of yours. i have researched your archives and got virtually nothing on this subject. thank you"

"Carbon Cycles are not the same as Climate Change Problems ! Sea level has been stable over the last 100 years .None of the PREDICTIONS by the Alarmists   were proven correct . Climate of Planet Earth has been related to Sun's Activities,  Earth's Orbit and Tilts which are and were Not Constant ……from ~20 to 24.5 degree with a 41,000 Cycle !  We had GREEN SAHARA  in the past !  CO2 levels in Air are relatively Stable so far.  But Earth and Climate Will Change in the long term . ( BBC has documentary on Orbit and Tilts  etc.  )"
"Dont be a sheep. Green solutions are being held hostage by capitalism and have been since the combustible engine was invented. That's why there are no affordable options. Climate projects are promises about an uncertain future built on speculation all rolled up in a sales pitch and used by people that made a career out of getting more sales for more money by any means necessary. Our brightest minds cant tell us the future...neither can the fat guy in sales. Every option is a gamble for the price of a guarantee. If it reduces your cost of fuel, energy, or anything else the price is hiked as much as possible and the consumer is financed with interest. A salesman takes the money you would free up from their project (unless theres uncertainty in our future) plus tax credits from the government, looks at your income, decides how much to charge per unit or project, and overwhelms you with details. Next you know you're FINANCING an uncertain future. Sure...the fat guy in sales is doing his job the best he can in hopes that someday it will pay off just like the rest of us. But allowing companies to use green tech and projects to benefit from exploiting the environment (and us) from a problem they caused and financing it to us is the ultimate insult. I guarantee industry would change everything about the way they impact the environment if they got the bill for it. Of course they would just add it to the consumers bill. But at least that way green projects wouldnt be a new industry with the demand to charge who knows what... it would be one thing that every business also does to pay for their mess while minimizing current contributions to the mess and waving money around to anyone offering commercial equipment that can end the mess just to stay in business instead of...this. ill take death by climate over death by poverty any day. There is no motivation to resolve this from businesses because it instantly puts their ""green"" business out of business . There'll never be a cure for cancer for the same reason. This is why industry can never serve man because it has tricked man into serving industry with blind faith. Stop allowing your government to tell you that there's nothing they can do about your government. My apologies to the guy in sales...im aware that you have to feed an even fatter guy than you. Just using you to make a point. You've trimmed up nicely though..."

With the massive co2 being released in the Antarctic from under the ice adding to the damage us Humans are doing. Still the masses are powerful quit waiting on the few in Government to do something. This is why I call out the hypocrisy in my new song You Can SMC because together we are strong.
"Co2 is an distraction manipulation from plastic and other pollutions. 
It cant raise global temperture anyway, since 
that would violate The Thermodynamic law.
C02 cools efficiently as it heats, that is universal fundamental law. Like a black plate heats up better than a white plate, but the black plate also cools faster than a white plate. Incredible how effective the  brainwashing have been.
I assure you, on cloudless night the heat vanish into space, there is no global greenhouse effect."
"Why do we still have central means of electricity production?  When the solution is already available.  Solar panels + Solar Battery (I have this already and in summer my electricity use is 100% solar powered) on every house, building, warehouse, school, rooftop etc.  All new cars are Electric cars immediately, the ones with or without solar panel rooftops (already available).  Just bring it in, never mind the inconvenience - all new cars must be electric by 2023.  All new small trucks must be something like a rivian or tesla cybertruck or equivalent.  All new heavy trucks must be hydrogen or electric trucks.  That would be a huge help"
bro half shaved 💀
The growing green movement is a growing anti human movement. Some of the green agenda if pushed to its full extent will have devastating consequences for some people especially the poor. Us rich westerner s have more options. Taking away cheap energy will hurt the poor first. I admit that it is to our benefit to do things better. EVs in cbd is a great idea but banning the ICE is an elitist idea so the poor just can’t move about.
Al Gore claimed the 'Seas are literally boiling.'              Where exactly is this happening?  Boiling point is 100°c. Like in my kettle....  can anyone show me where the sea is doing this?
"DAC (Direct Air Capture) is not a working technology as of now. It needs great amounts of energy to work and basically has a very low sinking/emissions ratio. It will take years or decades to make it work and scale it. The main tool we have to limit otherwise catastrophic damage is to slash emissions now (the next 10 year will be crucial). To aid the decarbonization process, other carbon sinks - especially nature-based - might be deployed, but only as a supplement to emissions cuts. A word to editors: 9.5 bn tons of Carbon (as world yearly emissions) is not accurate. In fact, 9.5 bn tons of Carbon = 34 bn tons of Co2, (multiply 9.5 by 44/12, the ratio of molecular weights of Co2 vs C). But we know (for example from the Emissions Gap Report of UNEP) that we emit something in the range of 42 bn tons of Co2, not 34. (Plus there is all the rest of non-Co2 GHGs carbon emissions, such as methane, which brings the total to about 55-59 bn of Co2 equivalents)."
excellent - points to our need for a circular global economy in place of the current linear one - that seems to me to be the elephant in the room that will make or break life on earth - multinational corporations call the shots
This is all lies.
"Yeah the carbon doesn’t get completely sequestered when plants die and get buried, microorganisms which break down those plants also release the carbon as well as volcanism. Warmer liquids hold less CO2 and can be demonstrated by a cold and hot soda being opened. These fools are trying to tell you “only humans can” heal the earth, which has been healing itself from climate disasters since as long as there have been climate. There is a reason why they call it “a negative emissions scheme” because it is a scheme which is something you pull on the naive."
More plant food= more plants
Lucid explanation. Enlightening.
Great job Economist
"Great video, but as a professional media company, why not use higher quality microphones and cameras for this? On the TV this looks and sounds awful."

The voiceover in this video is kind of unsettling
"Solution to the Global Warming problem is to forcibly implement the establishment of Carbon Capturing Plants within the vicinty of all fossil fuel emitting industries all across the globe  such as Thermal/Coal Gas based Power Projects,Petroleum Mining and Quarying plants,Cement Factories and Iron and Steel Industries."
"XPRISE CARBON CAPTURE 
The heat loss from a smokestack can be forced into a large tank containing hot liquid microcrystalline petroleum wax. The heat will keep the wax at a molten state which facilitate the carbon to be absorbed when combined with the wax. Carbon when mixed with wax reacts like a dye. The wax-carbon amalgamation result in a black wax solution thereby making it impossible for the carbon to escape into the environment. Other toxic particles are also captured in the wax settling at the bottom of the wax holding tank forming into a sludge. A sludge release valve is located at the bottom of the tank. After the sludge is removed more wax is replaced in the vessel working something like a toilet. The sludge becomes a byproduct that can be used as an additive to asphalt for roads or used for cocooning nuclear waste materials for long-term safe burial. The entropy of the Earth has been increasing at a startling rate since the beginning of the industrial revolution caused mainly by the carbon that is released into the atmosphere. Government scientists have failed to stop and prevent carbon pollution from entering the environment. This problem can only worsen until a solution is found before this problem becomes irreversible. It has been discovered that formulated wax has been shown to be the only answer to this problem. William Nelson"
"I have moved close to work and shopping which has reduced my carbon footprint on travel. I ride my bike when possible. I live in a condo and that reduces my utilities in comparison to a house, I have outfitted the condo with energy efficient lighting and appliances all the while mindful on how I use them. I also like how condos house more people on a small piece of land. I will definitely be looking at a electric vehicle once we can get the parkade retrofitted for charging stations. I try to recycle as much as possible and even better try to buy what I need rather than a bunch of things I just like. With that I am still looking for ways to do better."
How much CO2 has gone into the atmosphere due to unnecessary manufacturing because of planned obsolescence? What do economists or atmospheric scientists say about that?
"Thanks, nice video."
Highly informative
"Did anyone ever think that the earth underneath the seas could just be warming up the water causing the weather changes?
Think about it, there has lately been a rise in the vulcano activity which has been parallel to the natural disasters in the world..."
"Well the first 20 seconds is a lie, so I’m guessing the rest is the same."
"I don't understand why peoples understanding of the carbon cycle is so immature!!!!
Plants also go through cellular respiration!!! Plants also release CO2! 
It is just so juvenile to view the carbon cycle as ""plants take in CO2 then release O2 which animals breath in and then release CO2"", NO THAT IS NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING!!!
A better simplification would be ""Plants take in CO2 to produce sugars through a process called photosynthesis, the Sugars are then. Stored or broken down to produce energy that allow plants to grow biomass. Plants breakdown sugars through a process called Cellular respiration which releases CO2. Animals eat the biomass of the plant then breaks down the sugars also through cellular respiration which releases CO2. The CO2 released through both plant and animal respiration is re-captured by plants for photosynthesis"""
Love The Economist.
"Every 25.200 years, a new ice age occurs. We can predict the next ice age when we know that the last one was in the year 10.844 BCE. Idiocy? No, knowledge. Ancient knowledge that is neglected or denied by all historians, geologists and other scientists. Ancient books as the Mahabharata from India and the Popol Vuh from the Maya tell us that our planet Earth suffers from a cycle of seven world era's that are seperated by a natural disaster. There is only one possible cause of such a cycle to happen. A Ninth planet in our solar system that must orbit our sun in an eccentric orbit. Than it is close to our sun for a short while, crossing at a high speed, and it disappears into the universe for at least a few thousand years. During its crossing through its perihelion, the place closest to the sun, it causes, beacause of the gravitational pull, a huge tidal wave that is pulled all over the globe, due to its movement and the turning earth. The water is pulled up so high that it freezes. After the crossing, the gravitational pull decreases and the ice falls back on our planet in pieces ""as big as mountains"". So the northern part of the earth is covered with ice in just a few days. Planet 9 is known by many names that are often referring to local gods. Zeus, Seth, Shiva, Quetzalcoatl and Nibiru.

1000 years is a very short period here. There was over 1400 parts per million of co2 in the air when humanity started
I bet our childrens life we will change our habit by force and not by choice. The addiction to fossil fuel is too strong.
"I would be more inclined to believe that man has any impact on climate through the use of fossil fuels if 1) scientists were not defunded for suggesting otherwise, 2) historical climate records had not been modified to hide warmer temperatures, 3) climate models were remotely accurate, 4) perennial predictions of climate disaster were proved true or even if 5) the mainstream media's reporting were credible, rather than an endless stream of propaganda. But since that's not the case, I just don't believe this nonsense, and it breaks my heart tha the one newssource I used to trust (The Economist) now espouses this nonsense."
"why not mention the ocenas wiich contain up to 50x air based carbon

Any one want power shortages and  500% higher power bills!

why not mention muclear power?"
"only humans can fix it? HOW  humans are responsible for about 5% of total emissions  and no proof of co2 changing any climate, in fact humans are flourishing as never before"
"earths delicately balanced carbon vycle? what, its gon up  0.03% to 0.04% give us a break with this BS😂"
some scientists SAY  ooooh scary😂😂😂😂
"To all you knuckleheads who believe in this alarmism - How do you get around, do you ride a bicycle? Doubt it.
Do you use the luxuries of air conditioning, TV, the internet? Do you live in a house with oil everywhere - Paint, tables, beds, carpet etc etc? Do you use electricity and gas when you want and need it, or do you use a solar panel disconnected from the grid which goes on and off intermittently? Refrigerator? New cell phone? Big toxic batteries which were mined? Travel on planes (well..)?

All of these things (yes even the bicycle, solar panels etc) require huge amounts of fossil fuels (eww) to produce and use, and I mention this to climate alarmists. Clearly if they believed the world is going to end in 10 years they would behave like it."
The problem is not carbon dioxide but oxygen that nobody mentioned. We consume the oxygen constantly generated by Forest which is constantly consumed by humans.
I can focus on the issues he was talking about because of his beard 🤣
I don't think we're going to do anything about climate change. just keep going.  I don't put a cast on my arm until it's broken.

When they call you for an interview and you didnt get the time to finish shaving your beard.
5:29 I did not know that the field of science known as Geology had any  in situ carbon absorption qualities.
"Just...wow. Didn't think an ""economist"" would care about climate change tho"
"Why there is an underlying tone of hatred to human development and progress. When they put the first clip of the industrial revolution, they put that scary sound effect along with it. Why I feel like there is an ungrateful sentiment in this whole video. I mean, it is complicated. Yes, climate change is happening, and yes humans have increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, but at least we stopped dying at the age of 4! Also, we've only been aware of our impact on the climate since the 1960s. That's not a long time ago, and we aren't doing very bad for people who just woke up to the problem. The world is not going to end from climate change, and we will be okay, as is the earth and the ecosystems will be. Technological development, and reduced poverty will be the most important aspects when it comes to battling climate change. Not stopping fossil fuels. Fossil fuels will be abandoned if renewables are more attractive. Therefore we need to make renewables more attractive and not just demand that fossil fuels be banned, and demonize humans and human development. Read Bjørn Lomborg if you want to know more about what I'm talking about."
Why you didn't mention GHG emissions by cattle rearing industry which is way more than other sources of emission. This tacit ignorance of THE REAL FACTOR speaks of your ethics and research
"Can someone explain to me why the Earth can't easily make up for the human emissions by absorbing more CO2? I read that Earth is a natural carbon sink, so why shouldn't it be able to absorb the extra amount by, in a sense, feeling that things are out of balance and adjusting for it? 
By the way, I'm not a climate denier; just want to understand better."
I wonder what cost of one of those negative carbon facilities
What a beard!!
"the us president donald dumb had said before there is no climate change, thats why he pulled usa out of the climate change treaty. so you guys stop worrying about climate change."
"""key to reversing the damage..."" Yeah, we can't reverse it, at least not in human lifetimes. It will take centuries. The best we can do is slow down the warming. This is why people who understand this stuff are freaking out."
"It's impossible to reserve our nature while we still use fossil fuels, until we switch to clean energy. Why don't we just do that now? Because that's not cheap. It's gonna collapse entire oil industry, and the cost of building the infrastructure is magnificent. So, we're not gonna do that until the emergence of human extinction caused by the backlashing natural disaster we'll bring upon ourselves, at that time it'll be too late"
"Very comprehensive coverage.
Thank you.."
is incredible how the system lead directly to the mass to do whatever the system wants
Thanks for explanation!
ty for sharing
If you can change your beard we can focus on your talks on climate change.
I am guessing those over grown side burns are meant to function as amplified sinks
A case of sideburns overreach
"Just to explain you all about this man’s beard; he is using his beard as a metaphor for the planets deforestation, every hair resembles 1 hectare of forest left. This practice is commonly know as voodoobearding"
Videos like this are dumb. This is information that everyone already knows. Climate skeptics don't understand how carbon dioxide increases temperature. I think the vast majority of people don't understand the greenhouse effect. At some point someone needs to make content that actually explains the greenhouse effect to people who aren't scientists.
Humans won't fix this.
Earth don't care cause it will still  keep going but for us humans ..... Gg
fake news
Why he looks like this? How I am supposed to trust your documentary?
this man’s beard. xD
"Here is your climate change; Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall. Real simple."
Very happy to see more informational videos about climate change. Would love to see more videos on what people can do to help and videos encouraging more political engagement! Reviews of carbon fee and dividend or reviews of legislation like the USE IT ACT.
Totally love this.thank you♥

Comment
"Climate change has nothing to do with CO2 emissions. It has to do with the precession of the earth axis. We are entering the turn around phase, so the climate will change regardless of EV""s, or other CO2 reduction technology. Time for people to wake up from this nonsense."
Climate change is a HOAX!
"Where a person falls on the climate change issue has more to do with people's psychology, Pessimist, Optimist, or Realist.  The Climate Change Activist are Pessimist:   see the worst aspect of things or believe that the worst will happen.  Some people are optimist:   tends to be hopeful and confident about the future.  I am a Realist:  things are changing but I see many positives since the world population keeps growing, the change in temperatures went exponential after 1960 when the world's population grew from 3 billion to over 8 billion, we need the benefits of a warmer climate, plants/algae/phytoplankton love CO2 because photosynthesis combines CO2 and Water to produce Oxygen and Carbohydrates,  we need the oxygen & food.  Humans are effecting the balance, population growth is the cause, more CO2 is the solution."

Watch out now trying to preach basic science remember we had some morons during this covid bulshit claim to be scientists that was wrong all the way from day one
But I do have to laugh at these climate more on that was super glue their self to the desk or something like that we got a bunch of idiots running around here preaching climate acting like a bunch of fools
🆘 Remember all you liberal fake news people and incompetent Joe Biden; China emits more CO2 in just two weeks than Australia does in a year. So good luck getting to net zero to save the planet. China will never agree.
"Slight problem is that with plants requiring CO2, and with only .04% of the atmosphere being CO2, and the fact that humans only produce 1% of that .04% of CO2, it's a demonstrable fact that humans are NOT the cause of CO2 rises, number 1, and 2 is even more important, CO2 rising will cause life to increase, not decrease. and 3rd, melting ice will cause water levels to decrease not increase."

"How ironic. Video posted just before the plandemic. Lady compares climate change to doctor saying take this medicine or youll probably die, then many who take it do die from myocarditis ( which is being kept hidden from the public)  If you actually listen to most ""skeptics"" you will find their skepticism is not about whether climate change exists. Its about how much is attributable to human actvity ( because its mainly nature), how green the measures to combat it are (because they're mostly not) , how devastating a small rise in temperature  and co2 is (because its not detrimental) , why every event is attributed to ""man made climate change"" by the catastrophists , why people have the delusion that we can realistically make much significant difference ( without mass genocide or living in horrific and impoverish conditions , with major health implications) and who makes obscene amounts of money from the so called green transition?

"What is climate change?
It’s not what you’re lead to believe.
Putting aside any scientific debate about anthropogenic climate change and wether or not it’s dangerous or simply exaggerated the FACT is that it is a SCAM!
It’s an age old political tactic to unite people behind a common enemy to gain power.
Hitler used the science of eugenics to unite the populace against all those who would pollute the master race, this included members of the master race who didn’t stack up by being mentally ill, deformed, homosexual or any other excuse that could be used to label anyone an enemy of state. By attacking minorities openly with propaganda and targeted violence, even those who had moderate beliefs and would happily befriend and even defend the minorities began out of fear to comply and assist in targeting the “others” lest they be othered.
In a meeting in a European country with a socialist democratic government and little or no industry or resources a decision was taken to spread socialism by uniting the world behind a common enemy.
This time the enemy would be universal and sufficiently obscure that few would have the knowledge and reasoning to immediately see that there is no such enemy, and the few who could see this fact would be immediately targeted as deniers and shills of big oil etc etc. Even some of the very scientists who were in a position to call out the lie were so fiercely targeted that they lost their jobs funding and even ended up in court trying to prove the truth.
So regardless of what the climate change alarmists say climate change is in fact a scam and unfortunately by falling for the scam the world is now in greater danger than it has been since The Cuban missile crisis."
Here's  a couple of facts .04%co2 in atmosphere 3% of that is the amount we put in  As you can see it is very little  now with computer models they are always wrong predicting 4yr in a row weather  going to be hot and dry they were mild and wet suggeston take man made co2 out of computer model. I reckon you get closer Imagine this little amount could be a problem just a thought
"Pollution is increasing very much in this world and we need to reduce it, otherwise it may threaten the future generations."
I’m still wondering how much agriculture has to do with this. We mono crop millions of acres worldwide destroying the existing and ancient carbon bank that the heathy soil once was. The dust bowl on a world wide scale.
What about all the wars? The lack of medical care?  What about all the sewage being pumped into the rivers?
It is the biggest load of bull ever for the most brainwashed people in the world. If its cold its not normal if its hot it's not normal.
The only way to stop climate change is simple we are the problem remove the human you remove the problem😮
"These ""heads of states"" are what seems to conclude to be simply their perpetual ""Built in Contingencies""...nothing more, nothing less!!"
"It is all totally pointless unless we can get India and China to reduce their emissions, and for some reason we see very little real pressure put on them to do anything."
"CLIMATE CULT timeline to Apocalypse 
1970s - Global cooling will kill us all.
1980s - Oops sorry, Looks like Global warming will kill us all.
1990s - Global warming will definitely kill us all.
2000s - Global warming stopped. UN memo (original). Lets call it Climate Change because the temperature keeps fluctuating up and down.
2010s - Everyone realises climate change is normal. UN memo (1). Let’s call it a Climate Emergency.
2010s - There was no climate Emergency. UN memo (2). Let’s corrupt the science with false temperature data and call it a Climate Crisis.
2020s - The Climate Crisis failed to eventuate. UN memo (3). Let’s find a useful idiot and name her Greta. She will be our climate cult Goddess.
2022 - Greta failed to change the climate and just yelled at everyone.
2023 - UN memo (4). We will wait for El Nino to arrive and we shall call it Global Boiling. We shall also supplement fear with cult arson attacks throughout Europe. We shall start in Greece.
2024 - Everyone realises El Niño is a natural event that has always occurred for as long as the Pacific Ocean has been in existence. 79 arsonists are arrested in Greece.
2025 - UN memo (5). We shall declare CO2 a toxic hazard that will kill us all.
2025 - UN memo (5) is immediately cancelled when it was pointed out by a 9 year old that CO2 is the trace gas of life without which we and all carbon based life forms do not exist. All that carbon came from CO2. It is called a trace gas because there are traces of it measured at 420ppmv or 0.042%. Barely enough to raise the temperature in a room full of climate cult members releasing methane in a desperate attempt to raise the temperature.
2030 - The climate cult is exhausted from its endless lies and doubles down for another decade of stupidity.
2040 - The UN admits defeat and commences the biggest compensation payout in human history.
PS - Now we can add permafrost thaw according to COP 28.
How many more decades do we tolerate the lies and endless wrong predictions of the climate cult clowns that destroy everything they touch."

"Can you give me some help?  I really want to continue living, be happy and have children;  but I see many people saying that it is no longer possible to reverse climate change and that the future is chaotic and anyone who argues that it is still possible to reverse climate change is a denialist.  What I do?  That is true?  I don't deny that global warming exists, I know it's real, but I believe it can still be reversed and I've seen certain predictions that scientists got wrong (New York would be submerged in 2019, the Amazon would be a desert in 2010, there would be no more snow in 2000 etc.).  I'm afraid that the current coastal cities will no longer exist because they will be submerged, that there will be a lack of food, that there will no longer be cold or snow, or habitable life in the equatorial/tropical zones, etc.  I've seen news that the hole in the ozone layer has shrunk.  I've seen news saying that the ozone layer doesn't help reduce the effects of climate change.  But I've seen old news that said that climate change was caused by the hole in the ozone layer. Many people talk about mitigating climate change or preparing/adapting to it because it can no longer be reversed.  I don't want to soften it, I really want to reverse it.  And I believe it can still be reversed.  Are you sure that climate change cannot be reversed?  I also saw a girl from Bangladesh saying that to combat climate change we have to decolonize the system;  i.e. hating the US and Europe to combat climate change.  I think this is unnecessary.  I plant trees, I save water; I see governments, people, politicians, countries and scientists collaborating for the environment and helping to combat climate change but I still see people saying that there is no point in wasting time planting trees and replacing cars from fossil fuels to electric cars as climate change is irreversible.  Please help me.  I'm nervous and no one answers me or helps me.  It's a locked door with 900 padlocks!"

"There is no ""climate crisis"" to worry about. You are disseminating false propaganda by using the imaginary temperature data and imaginary Carbon dioxide data fabricated by the Alarmist Climate Change organizations as imaginary substitutes for the historical temperature observations, the true temperatures, and the actual atmospheric concentrations of Carbon dioxide. The present Carbon dioxide levels are LOWER or about EQUAL to the 415 ppm average and 574 maximum levels observed in 1827-1829 and the below and above 400 ppm averages and the 550 ppm maximum observed in 1939-1941. The observational evidence demonstrates how the imaginary numbers fabricated by the Climate Change Alarmists and presented in this video have zero scientific validity."
I believe it is crucial for us to give significant attention to climate change.
we must try to protect the earth for us
This video gave me a better idea of global warming.Thank you!
We need to be alert to climate change and try to address it and not harm future generations.

Climate Change is  a Scam. They just want our money and keep us poor
"We all talk about emissions control. Carbon emissions however many of us also say that development is needed for every nation. However question rises why do we need so much development why not concentrate on controlling carbon dioxide, more trees, less deforestation. China has the highest emissions of carbon."
"Dr Prof. Valentina Zharkova

So the earth is NOT WARMING IS COOLING!!

We have entered the Grand Solar Minimum, and there's no doubt about it. Some people have even repeated our findings. Kitty Ashvily from NASA published a paper in 2020 that echoed our results. They repeated our findings, confirming the same magnetic field changes. NASA has identified this upcoming solar cycle as the weakest in 200 years, which will likely lead to a global cooling period 2030 to 2100.

Now, you might wonder why we believe there will be global cooling. Let's recall what happened during the Grand Solar Minimum. The irradiance curve from the Little Ice Age, as reproduced by Lenatal, clearly shows a drop in solar radiance from 1366 to 1363 watts per square meter. This had a significant impact on temperatures, leading to a drop of approximately one degree.

Similar temperature drops occurred during the Dalton Minimum. Every time there is a prolonged minimum, temperatures decrease dramatically. The calculations suggest that we can expect a drop in solar irradiance during the upcoming Grand Solar Minimum. In fact, research by Shin Delta to One in Science supports this idea.

This drop in temperature has implications for various regions. Some areas might experience temperature increases, but Northern Europe and North America are likely to face significant temperature drops. We could see conditions similar to the ""deep freeze"" that occurred in the past.

The drop in temperature is related to a decrease in ozone layer abundance in the atmosphere. This, in turn, affects atmospheric circulation patterns, leading to fluctuations in the northern jet streams. These changes allow cold air from the north to propagate towards the south. Europe and North America are particularly vulnerable to these shifts in the jet streams, which result in colder weather."
"To change everything about the way we run out world, stop trying to control nature. Follow the african model. Are you willing to? Or dontou want to still eat your cake and have it?

"The propaganda campaign continues. Fortunately, increasing people are recognizing this con for what it is. The climate is changing, it has always done so, and will continue to do so. Claiming that the rate of change, and nature of change is discernible as aberrant, and that it is attributable solely to human activity is absolute balderdash."

SAVE THE EARTH
CLIMATE CHANGE
I am sure most of you heard of the climate changes on the news recntly. Icebergd are melting, more and more volcanoes are errupting every day, we aslo have increased nunber of wildfires that are destroying miles and miles of forests and burning entire villages to the ground and more andf more animals are exposed to threat of dying and losing their natural habitat. We have to do something to prevent this. For hundreds of years we as humans were damaging environment in every way possible. Deforestation, increased use of fossil fuels, greenhouse effects and so much more. Trees are very important for us as they turn carbon dioxide into oxygen. Every day thousands and thousands trees are being cut down. Nobody wants to replant them. It takes very quick to cut down a tree but for a tree to grow full size it takes up to 100 years. Ozone layer is damaged very much and it is letting through bg nuber of dangerous UV rays. UV rays melt icebergs and damage plants, human skin and animals. Fossil fuels aren't very dangerous until they go through the process of burning. Fossil fuels are being burn through engines of our cars, bikes, etc. They are being lett out into atmosphere in the form of very poisonus gases that over time create holes on ozone layer. When errupting, volcanoes let out very poisonus gases and ashes into atmosphere. Those are by far worse than fossil fuels. But how to stop it? Here is what we all can do to help Earth to get back to it's normal. 

HOW TO STOP CLIMATE CHANGE?
Iti s actually very easy as we all can take part in helping the Earth. It will take a very long time but if we persist hard enough we will help our planet a lot. Here is what we all can start doing. We can save energy at home by unpluging all electrical devices(TV-s, PC-,etc.) after we are done with using them, manage your heating and cooling, shut dors and close curtains, get best energy deal, etc. You help environment bus also save some money so both you and environment have use of it. Change your home's energy source. You can switch to solar power and solar heating, wind energy, hydroelectric systems, etc. Most recommended are solar panels and wind turbines. Instead of driving your car to job very day, you can walk, cycle or even run to your work every day. That way you aren't damaging the environment and it is good for your health.

CLIMATE HOAX.. it's REAL it's SERIOus and time to END THE HOAX
JUST CHECK THE COSTS OF ENERGY IN GERMANY.... THIS IS ANTI-HUMAN AGENDA TO ROB HUMANITY OF TRILLIONS OF $$S UNDER THE GUISE OF CLIMATE CHANGE.... climate changed for billions of years and will continue to do so
"SOLAR AND EV BATTERIES ARE NOT RENEWABLE, THEY REQUIRE TONS OF MINING WHICH IS VERY POLLUTING, BREAK DOWN FAST, ENERGY IS UNPREDICTABLE .... they also use forever chemicals which are devastating the environment and harmful to health.... once they dispose of all those solar panels, EV batteries and wind turbines, it will be a lot of toxic waste.  Not to mention solar and wind farms require huge area and devastate animal and plant life, kill birds of prey and whales..."
"If they want to protect the planet, you can cancel 90% of more PHARMA POTIONS WHICH ARE HARMFUL TO PEOPLE AND EXTREMELY POLLUTING"
REAL CHANGE IS GLOBALISTS STEALING TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT OF HUMANITY.... INSTEAD they could solve world hunger and other pressing issues....
"Bunch of LIES AND RUBBISH.... climate is going to change regardless what you do..... CARBON IS BENEFICIAL FOR PLANET, FOOD PRODUCTION AND GREENING THE EARTH"
SO THIS IS IS THE TYPE OF PROPAGANDA AND LIES THEY PUSH ON KIDS IN SCHOOLS..... UNREAL.... PAST WARM PERIODS BEFORE OIL AND GAS USE WERE TIMES OF PROSPERITY AND INCREASED FOOD PRODUCTION... CLIMATE HAS BEEN CHANGING FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS
8 years later .no change .

"N                                         Global Warming Will End---God's Way

     The Bible tells us that ""the former of the earth and the Maker of it.... did not create it simply for nothing."" (Isaiah 45:18) The Bible also says: ""The earth endures forever."" ---Ecclesiastes 1:4, The New English Bible. 

     Yes, God will not allow the earth to be rendered uninhabitable. Rather, he will intervene in human affairs and bring an end to failed human rule and those who have no regard for the earth. At the same time, he will preserve alive all who lead morally upright lives and sincerely want to please him. Saya Proverbs 2:21, 22: ""The upright are the ones that will reside in the earth, and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it. As regards the wicked, they will be cut off from the very earth, and as for the treacherous, they will be torn away from it."""
I agree with this proposal
To address global warming it is essential to explore various solutions beyond those presented in the video
"As is to be expected the lies are front and center.

The “hottest summers” are exclusively the result of data manipulation. Outside of the urban heat sinks 13 of those 15 “hottest summers” were below the historic average.

 Carbon is NOT a greenhouse gas. Most empirical evidence proves that the planet has had significantly HIGHER levels of carbon for the majority of the geological epochs. The releasing of carbon from its sequestration will INCREASE plant growth and expand the usable zone of farming.

The UN IPCC is NOT a scientific body but is in fact a political organization who has the internal mandate to maintain the economic status quo."
"Global warming is a significant issue caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels. To address it, we should shift to cleaner energy sources like solar and wind power, improve energy efficiency, and consider carbon taxation. Electric vehicles and public transportation can help reduce emissions.

In addition to technological solutions, reforestation and waste reduction are crucial. International cooperation is essential, as is educating the public about climate change. Continued innovation in sustainable technologies is also necessary.

Collectively, these efforts can help mitigate global warming and protect our planet."
"there is no climate crisis anyway - it's a marxist NWO hoax. the ""science"" is biased and corrupted because alarmists get financially rewarded while skeptics get cancelled or otherwise punished. nobel prize-winning scientist Ivar Gaevar has described global warming as ""pseudoscience"""
Creative Society
"As a human being living in this world, borned in 1992, Vietnam, lived in Australia for 15 years. No one ever tell me about climate change. No school nor teachers ever tell me about global warming. No news nor human being around me including bosses and friends ever talk about enviromental disasters and collapsing nature habitats until i sit alone in one spot and start to watch news and find out about all the documentary myself. What is that telling the world about the impact of modern day society? Whoever care = care. Whoever don't care = never care."
"Stop deforestation, reduce pollution, let's make Earth a beautiful planet again"
"i see people waiting at school to pick up their kid,with their car running in the parking lot for 20  or 30 mins.people dont care, i can understand if you're driving, but not waiting in a parking lot with your car running."
I know how to bring cheep electricity and cut all those climate control deal's. Musk needs to rejump start the Tesla free electricity. Of course we will need lot's more tower's like the pyramids in every country and states. Number of them? I have 0 idea of that. Free is always better
What bothers me most is that large companies making profits are NOT BEING IDENTIFIED AS THE MAJOR POLLUTERS that are not being held responsible nor PAYING FOR THE POLLUTION THEY MAKE!
The NG swindle goes on...
It's everyone's responsibility today. It climate change and sustainability are top urgent matters of present-day.

"Stop the chem trails and the weather, will improve.We all saw what the weather was like when we were all on lock down the air cleared up birds came back. now everything is open again and now they are testing  environments. buy blocking out the sun with these chem trails which is causing  bad weather ,in other places.  do not take my word for it look it up. and every now and again look up .to the sky look at the haze around the sun light clouds, Wake up people .Its called solar Geonengineering and guess who is funding it ?"
"Regenerative agriculture is the solution to global warming. It involves keeping the soil covered with vegetation because the bare soil releases tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Any cover crop whether it's grass, crops, shrubs, or trees, sequesters carbon by the tons and puts it in the soil where it regenerates healthy soil to grow nutrient dense crops. Plowing the soil of farm acreage and leaving it bare for any length of time is the worse for our planet yet it is being done on trillions of acres around the globe. Correcting this error in the way we farm can make immeasurable strides in solving global warming. It dwarfs one individual's efforts, like driving 10 miles less each day, and puts the burden on giant agro- corporations, as well as petroleum an energy producers which is where it belongs.  We all, around the globe, drove our cars less during the pandemic and there was little reduction in global warming. Stop making us feel guilty and instead confront the giants who have the solution in their hands."
6 years ago we were experiencing climate change. And doing it till date yet there's no change in our thinking and mentality towards our planet.
All built on very manipulative models
"Global warming has nothing to do with auto exhaust or emissions. There has been a substantial rise in volcanic activity over the last hundred years especially in the oceans. This has increased the temperature of the land, the sea, and the air. The earth's climate is most likely changing back to what it was 2,000 years ago when it was much warmer. When the Romans were in Britain (40BC-380AD) they grew citrus fruit in the north."
"Climate change: No, it is NOT real as a human caused phenomenon. No, it is NOT serious unless humans are too arrogant to see that it falls to us to adapt to naturally occurring processes."
WE CANT FIGURE WEATHER WEEKLY ........
"This documentary isn’t realistic.

"in the 60’s we were supposed to have global starvation with hundreds of millions of deaths, as told by eminent scientist Paul Erhlich .  in the 70’s we were supposed to experience global cooling, and a new ice age. in the 80’s the wise ones shifted  their dire predictions to global warming, but that failed to materialize too. sadly, scientists and hucksters like Al Gore have all disappointed with failed climate predictions, but they get still get funding and or some like Gore make big money on carbon credits"

Imagine being a clown like Ben Shapiro and arguing against climate change reality.
"I don't think most people are denying climate change is real, I'm almost certain people are saying that by doing any of the changes that are presented will have such a small change it basically won't affect it. I mean it's pretty much common sense and requires a simple search.. For people who are upset with the way things are, you do understand that China and Russia are the worlds biggest problem in this department, right? You think they're gonna stop? Absolutely not. And again even if they did it would have little to no affect on climate change."
"Good video, but I want to see the cons of moving to renewable energy sources. There are always tradeoff to any change. I dislike that schools only teach us one side of the story. I'm not saying this video is wrong in any way, but I want to see other viewpoints too."

5. Name 2 solutions or ways to reduce emissions"
"Pretty disappointed in this video by National Geographic. They can do a lot better.  EV's, Solar Panels and Wind turbines will not solve the problem.  Will someone actually think outside the box for once.  The start of the problem was Europe and UK cut down most of their trees.  The Jungle of the Sahara died for some reason.  The US is over using because we are greedy and wasteful.  We even ship our non-recyclable waste to poor countries to put in landfills.  No recyclables should leave the USA.  If we can't find a way to recycle them we should landfill them here at the cost of the producer and user.  Europe and UK need to plant trees.  Countries around the Sahara need to be paid by the world to plant trees.  Brazil needs to stop cutting trees or it will become a sahara.  The US needs to plant more trees than there are now in places that have water but no trees.  There are many more things that need to be done but the EV BS in the USA will not scratch the surface. We need to start living simpler lives."

Our emissions laws are a lot tougher here than Canada, Europe, China, India, Russia, etc. If we totally went the way rich leftwing politicians want it wouldn't have the impact they want people to believe in. I'm not saying it's a hoax. I am saying I don't believe everything politicians and their cronies push. I know several liberals worried about climate change and they want everyone else to drive EV's. But are they driving EVs? No. Are they driving conservatively? No. Are they limiting their travel? No. Are they limiting their air travel? No. So in other words they don't believe it either!"

"1. A 15-year-old individual, influenced by climate activist Greta Thunberg, approached the narrator at a party with concerns about carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. This person expressed a belief that carbon dioxide constituted over half of the Earth's atmosphere and feared suffocation or death from a heatwave before the age of 35.

2. The individual held a conviction that the high level of carbon dioxide was problematic and that it was a direct result of the older generations' actions.

3. In an attempt to provide accurate information and perspective, the narrator used a graphical representation similar to those used for COVID data to illustrate the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

4. The visual representation consisted of a large green square (representing the entire atmosphere) and a much smaller red square (representing carbon dioxide), which showed carbon dioxide as one part of every 2,500 parts of the atmosphere.

5. This graphical method faced opposition from some who were surprised or upset by the depiction, likening the reaction to religious offence taken at depictions of sacred figures.

6. The measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide has been taken accurately for 60 years at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, near a volcano.

7. Over this 60-year period, carbon dioxide levels have increased from 320 parts per million (ppm) to 420 ppm, indicating a rise but still showing carbon dioxide as a minor component of the atmosphere, emphasizing its proportion rather than its properties."
I’m just wondering the hubris that these scientists who think they know exactly how much PPM CO2 was in the atmosphere every year for the last billion years. And everyone believes them. Because some magic science thingy model they came up with

I hope renewable energy can be developed quickly in order to minimize climate chage.
I think we need to reduce the greenhouse effect that causes global warming
"Greenhouse gases have become a pressing concern in recent decades due to their significant impact on the environment and the subsequent consequences for human health, weather patterns, and other critical aspects of our world."
"I was aware of the causes and severity of climate change, which is the content of the video above. I thought I should do what I can do to prevent this from becoming more serious."
Global warming seems too serious
I hope humans realize the seriousness and try to alleviate global warming.
"Since the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide emissions have continued to increase. We need to find alternatives to the energy that produces carbon dioxide."
"To prevent severe climate change, we should try to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources."
"Through this video, I learned effect of climate change to human body."
Now I know the seriousness of climate change. THank u sooooo mucchhh!!!!!
I think we need to take feasible steps as soon as possible to slow climate change and enable countries around the world to implement it.

"what people don't understand is as long as there is a war or two going on in the world nothing we can do will offset the massive carbon footprints of these wars, it grows every day. Between that and corporate greed no ground can be gained, have you seen the ordinance they are letting off in these wars. your sacrifices will be taken up by these conflicts."
Are people stupid
"While carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere readily absorb ‘infrared radiation’ (heat), the atmospheric gases of nitrogen and oxygen do not. As the greenhouse gases absorb this heat energy, they energetically gyrate more and more wildly and collide with other atmospheric molecules, thus transferring their kinetic ‘energy of motion’ to them. This combined energetic field of kinetic vibration and radiant energy registers as thermal energy and is known as the greenhouse effect.

"Dr Prof. Valentina Zharkova

So the earth is NOT WARMING IS COOLING!!

We have entered the Grand Solar Minimum, and there's no doubt about it. Some people have even repeated our findings. Kitty Ashvily from NASA published a paper in 2020 that echoed our results. They repeated our findings, confirming the same magnetic field changes. NASA has identified this upcoming solar cycle as the weakest in 200 years, which will likely lead to a global cooling period 2030 to 2100.

Now, you might wonder why we believe there will be global cooling. Let's recall what happened during the Grand Solar Minimum. The irradiance curve from the Little Ice Age, as reproduced by Lenatal, clearly shows a drop in solar radiance from 1366 to 1363 watts per square meter. This had a significant impact on temperatures, leading to a drop of approximately one degree.

Similar temperature drops occurred during the Dalton Minimum. Every time there is a prolonged minimum, temperatures decrease dramatically. The calculations suggest that we can expect a drop in solar irradiance during the upcoming Grand Solar Minimum. In fact, research by Shin Delta to One in Science supports this idea.

This drop in temperature has implications for various regions. Some areas might experience temperature increases, but Northern Europe and North America are likely to face significant temperature drops. We could see conditions similar to the ""deep freeze"" that occurred in the past.

The drop in temperature is related to a decrease in ozone layer abundance in the atmosphere. This, in turn, affects atmospheric circulation patterns, leading to fluctuations in the northern jet streams. These changes allow cold air from the north to propagate towards the south. Europe and North America are particularly vulnerable to these shifts in the jet streams, which result in colder weather."

Al Qur'an

: “O Children of Adam! Eat and drink but waste not by excess, for God loveth not the wasters” ( Surah al Araaf, The Heights 7:31 ).

The Holy Qur’an has set down the foundations of water conservation and demand management by making it known to humankind that earth’s water resources are finite in verse 23:18 of Surah Al Mu’minun 


Prophet Muhammad SAW sayings :
Do not waste even if performing ablution on the bank of a fast flowing large river” (Al Thirmidhi).

One should not use water in excess (israf) even if one was “located on a flowing river” (Al Mughnee, 1992a, 298)......"

"Around 45% of potable water in Italy is lost through aging pipes. In contrast, Singapore has effectively addressed this issue, with a mere 2 or 3% wastage thanks to proactive leak detection and immediate repairs. It's a practice that all governments should consider before allocating significant funds to desalination projects."
Gold is a human right!
"Prise of Rain Water

Amount of water (in cu. m)
= Area (sq. m) * Rainfall (mm) / 1000

Amount of water (in lit)
= Amount of water (in cu. m) * 1000
= Area (sq. m) * Rainfall (mm)

1 acre = 4046.86 sq. m.

So, for 1.0 mm of rainfall on one acre:
Amount of water (in lit) = 4046.86 lit

Say max. Rainfall captured is 80% then for 1.0 mm of rainfall on one acre:
Amount of water (in lit)
= 80/100* 4046.86 
= 3237.488 lit

If price of pure drinking water is estimated only as ₹ 1.0 per liter then for 1.0 mm of rainfall on one acre land gives ₹ 3237.488

My place Darpaur has @ 630 mm as annual average rainfall.

Price of pure drinking water at ₹ 1.0 per liter then for 630 mm (80%) of rainfall on one acre land
= 630 * 3237.488
= 20,39,617.44 ₹

Say 20 Lakhs per acre only free without any crop (for rate ₹ 1.0 per lit only)."
"Hello, would you like to check out my documentary channel?"
If water is the new gold. Those human would not be polluting those water with shampoo and bleaches all around the world to run those hotels and motels.
Is water the new gold? Not unless NASA sends up to 150 million manned spacecraft missions to Europa and Enceladus to harvest their water!
The documentary paints a stark picture of the growing water crisis fueled by climate change. It's a wake-up call for all of us to cherish this precious resource and work towards sustainable solutions. Thank you for shedding light on this critical issue.
"Iba na zamyslenie: Kam sa ta voda akoze straca? Voda je nekonecny kolobeh, naprsi a vypari sa. Naprsi a vypari sa a takto to ide stale dookola. Voda nema kam zmiznut."
"The researchers at the Pacific Institute and GIWS, and the many others working on climate change research and policy have not been ignored by Pentagon. Even when the politics of the moment dictated denial of climate change, the military did what they usually do when they sense a threat -- they assessed it and devised a strategy to deal with it. They even published a plan that stated in no uncertain terms that climate change was real and meant trouble in much of the world. They also began preparing to deal with these new problems. DoD has continued to updated its strategic assessments and revising its plan and preparations. Not surprisingly, much of this work is not for public viewing. Be assured, although the military goes to great lengths to avoid being entangled in divisive political issues like the embarrassing debate about climate change, they do not ignore developments that threatened the nation and the lives of their people."

"Water has always been the most important commodity on Earth...as is light from the sun, yet to be harnessed properly, as it's a frequency that must be absorbed through frequency devices, not inefficient solar panels...or at least how they are created today...

We haven't run out of water, what we've run out of is the vast numbers of scientists that have tried to create new methods to use and extract it from the air over 100's of years now...yes, the thing called humidity and a bit of scientific principles...like using refrigeration to condense it and then efficient hydrolysis processes to use it for everything gas would be used for...

After millennium of usury by the world's controlling dynasties, those who try to evolve the world for the betterment of all have been routinely erased from history...and that's the true problem, we live on a planet that thrives from keeping the vast majority of society in constant state of poverty and inefficient consumption...

What the world has, on a global level, is a deficit of honesty and morals from those who have controlled society, not resources...

"As of this post, that guy would be under water at Lake Powell. Variability exists from extreme lack of water to complete capacity and too much water. To think there will be any observable pattern is ludicrous. The west has been hit hard for the last decade. Now we have a year of inconceivable record snow all over the west. Is it pattern? No. But just one year of record snow has brought much of the southwest out of drought. Should we rely on 1 in 500 year snow pack? No. But it happened. Put that water to use and create more sophisticated plans to never waste a drop."
Yes

And, everything's connected. Much of California's rain is dependent on atmospheric moisture generated by rainforests in South America. Literally. This isn't just some butterfly effect I'm talking about. That is what much of California's rain depends on. And the same is true for the region I live in. A combination of moist air from the Amazon and cold fronts originating from the South Pole result in the majority of our winter rainfall. I live across the Atlantic from the Americas."

I even said that a test  tube of water will cost over twenty five thousand dollars. Of course some of the replies were insulting and calling me crazy. I harvest rain water. But if it doesn't rain the there is no water. So I started doing the NASA Space Station experiment of collecting and distilling my urine. I use Home Depot buckets and fill them with my urine, then I distilled them when I have over 150 gallons of urine. I can even take Oxygen and Hydrogen out of the urine. I use the Hydrogen for energy. Our government  (United States and the infrastructure ) is going to collapse. So I converted my septic tank into a methane oxygenator where I can power my gas stove with gas. I also have a propane generator that I can generate electricity from my septic tank. Of course I have solar, wind and hydro power but redundancy is key and essential to survival. Window gardens for your veggies or if you have a secure piece of land you can grow and water your own food.

About time US does something about it
"US Citizens: Has anyone wondered what is ""Carbon Footprint""? And what is it for politicians?
Hint 1: Who of you knows how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere today? (without looking at Google)
Hint 2: CO2 is now 0.04% of the total in the earth's atmosphere !!! (volcanoes, people, cars, power plants). The US is responsible for 12% of global emissions.
I count: 0.0004 x 0.12 = 0.000048 that gives 0.0048% (!!!) of the total Earth's CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.
As you remember from mathematics, US emissions add billions of parts (!!!) to the atmosphere, increasing CO2 in the atmosphere.
It is like blowing a fart in Boeing's Everett
FAKE? Check it!"

We already know where that has brought us with disruption in fish breeding grounds and the terraforming of rivers and valleys. Why isn't the real cause being addressed? Population. Nobody wants to talk about population control to correct natural resource depletion? Cause you cant demand money from taxpayers to not have children.

I hope president biden begins by leaving airforce 1 on the ground along with all the other planes helicopters jeeps that must be mobilised when he travels. Do the next meeting using zoom.
"When dose the news report the facts anymore... the facts are under Trump US emissions were reduced by 36% which was more then any country in the Paris agreement (feel free to fact check me too). So Biden is only actually committing to a 14% reduction... about as impressive as his 100mil vaxs in 100 days when he was handed 1.3mil/day 7 day avg the day he took power.

You know how Trump did it to... fracking, yes fracking, nat gas has 40% less emissions then coal and he made it cheap, coal power is easy and cheap to convert to gas. It's not the endgame solution, but a very good stepping stone for those country's that have lots of coal or don't have nuclear."
Idiot
Good luck. People criticise Australia as we dont sign up to these unrealistic targets 500 to 100%. We said 25 and have done it. Action worth more than talk obama biden biden obama tomato/ tomato

*Democrats have to be the dumbest people on the face of the Earth!

"DO NOT TRUST BOLSONARO This Friday (23), the federal government announced a cut of R $ 240 million in the general budget dedicated to the Ministry of the Environment (MMA). The budget cut comes just a day after President Jair Bolsonaro (without a party) tells 40 world leaders at the Climate Summit that he would double the transfers to the areas of environmental oversight.

"Hey thanks Greta... If we wanted to hear what Davos was saying, we would ask them... What is it with mouthpieces these days?

"I am not saying the BBC has lost credibility over time... I think they have stayed relatively consistent....

Johnny Rotten pointed out that Jimmy Savile was sexually abusing our most vulnerable children on national TV.... 

The BBC then banned Johhny Rotten from the air for a decade... 

Meanwhile.... 

Their good old friend Jimmy Savile kept on molesting, at the expense of those poor children, who had nowhere to hide from that evil menace, all with the best wishes from the BBC.

Yeah, I'd say the BBC have been fairly consistent for a while now... This institution is a bought and paid for mouthpiece... 

Ironically, the BBC idolises another famous mouthpiece, Joseph Goebbels... He also spouted lies, while waiting patiently on his knees for a splash of gratitude from Hitler...In a 3 way with the BBC kneeling down, with Clementi and Gates standing above, which one wears the tiny little moustache?

You suck so hard BBC.... In every sense of the word... I would laugh at them but this institution has cost lives, destroyed livelihoods and promotes the abolition of human rights and civil liberties. Quite frankly, they remain a disgrace to any democratic society that aims to promote a sentiment of freedom ....  Anyone thinking the BBC are now out of character are sadly mistaken.....

Biden can't be gung-ho about this because when the Republicans get back in they'll just tear everything apart again. The Democrat goals must be more modest in order to encourage more moderate Republican to support them. A huge effort with huge claims will only attract deeper opposition.

Comment
"I've thought for some time that a major challenge for climate change action is convincing people that change is both _necessary_ and _possible._ Naïve optimism leads people to assume things will probably be fine, whereas despondant pessimism tells them it's already too late.

Or short-sighted self-interest can lead some straight from thinking it unnecessary to thinking it impossible: Change may be in some sense painful (e.g. diminished income or foregoing comforts), so they'd rather believe the problem isn't real. Once it becomes impossible to deny the evidence, they pivot to ""It's too late anyway, so why should I inconvenience myself in the name of a hopeless effort?""

I also wonder to what extent the social and political context we grew up in informs our attitude to this kind of issue. The ""end of history"" era instilled the idea that the big dramatic changes were all in the past, and it was going to be boring technocratic fiddling from there on out. Of course remarkable things are still achieved - we build ever taller skyscrapers, ever more powerful computers in ever smaller boxes, and so on - but it's all wrapped in the packaging of commerce and commodification. I think many of us struggle to conceive of anything significant being done for a reason other than direct profit. I think that kind of thinking is a trap: concerted deliberate effort can effect change. Don't give in to despair!"
What about climate changes due to greenhouse gases😢 we will get burnt alive in our own planet and some will get frozed alive😢
Thannks for this great video. I get almost dibilitatingly depressed when I bump into news about climate change to the point where you could almost mistake me for a denier. I'm currently not in any position to be worrying about these issues and how I could help aside from advocation/supporting some group. It seems that everywhere I go there is either denial or nihilism or biased optimism.
"This is easy , as it’s better to do something and be wrong , than doing nothing and be wrong.
Meaning even if you don’t believe in man made climate change , you should indeed still ,act and behave as if it was.
I mean , If you go all in playing poker , your odds should be good , the win should be awesome , and you should always minimize chances of loosing.
Today’s deniers are going blindly all in, they put their own kids future on stake , and what are their odds of winning ? Having by far most climate change scientist against them , I would argue the odds doesn’t look good .
But the biggest paradox’s is - what is their gain in a possible win ?
Is it the oil-riggers keeping their job for a few decades more !?
It’s insanely paradoxical that even intelligent people don’t even realize simple logic."
I literally heard bad news about global warming so many times now to the point where I just don’t care anymore
"There is no proof that climate change is caused by human activity. Also, consensus among scientists regarding this does not exist. Consider this fact- C02 makes up .04% of the atmosphere and only .01% of the .04% comes from human activity."
"hmmm  the problem is  tipping points and mehtane/carbon  releases in nature  that we cant control  and also cant account for in the models because nobody knows how bad theyre gonna be.  the other problem is  supposing somehow by a miracle we do limit global warming to a little over 2 degrees celcius.   we still dont know what conditions on earth will be like under those circumstances, nowhere is it written that 2.1 degrees is safe or that 1.5 degrees is safe for that matter.  those numbers were just plucked out of the air.    the good news for my money is that solar geoengineering is starting to be taken more seriously as an idea. not that i like the idea of solar geoengineering. i dont at all, its just that i like the idea of a future world where we just let the planet warm by however much its going to even less."
Here's some good news. It's a lie. We're all going to live. Go make babies and and raise them to not be sheep.
"The lowering of the CO2 emissions is not necessarily a matter of technology, but a matter of habits. From the top of my 60 years old, I can share changes that I (or we) made since we became aware of the climatic changes and the CO2 emissions going up. When I was young, the first thing I would do when buying a new car was taking it for a spin, and I mean, long drives. I would drive to the mountains just to see the landscape, I would go on the wine tour in autumn, I would go to the cottage to visit my parents just for a few hours (driving 320 kilometers). When I became aware that automobiles could be harmful to the environment and how we could affect our climate, I suddenly refrained going on a ride just for driving or driving hours for something I could do on the phone. I can’t remember in the last 15 years driving on a “nowhere” far from my home. Just this little change of behavior probable reduced my carbon footprint by a lot. I think that in my neck of the woods, many people have adopted that behavior. I am now living on a land with several hundreds of trees and I take pride in saying that I am carboneutral for the most part as I write this, despite driving a gasoline car. Some people want to go on trips on cruises in their retirement, I chose to stay put in the countryside with trees surrounding me on my land and appreciating them, especially in autumn. This, and recycling plastic (and other items) and not wasting food is all I can now do from the top of my 60 years old."
"There is no such thing as a climate ""activist"" nor ""alarmist."" They are all climate TERRORISTS."
"If you think humans can solve climate change, you are delusional. There have been ice ages and periods of global cooling that no human intervention can stop."
the best climate content!!!
Warmer is better.   Where is there more life?  The tropics or the Arctic?
In the days of our grandparents you would have been talked about.. Like... Did you hear that eejit?  Who was that eejit?   Do you think that eejit was paid enough for sacrificing the little bit of personal integrity he owned before hand?
"I'm positive there have been several accidents with nuclear energy.The human population is accused of consuming dioxins and is paying taxes for it, but it's an excuse for what some people did with energy further. We should be accused of consuming nuclear wastes."
The CCP lies about their economic growth all the time. What makes you think they won't lie about renewables adoption and carbon emissions?
"Sorry, but ALL the info you quoted for china, is....welll...complete madeup bullcrap.
The dip atm is down to the enonomy completely tanking.
The majority of the renewables built, don't do anything - they are a facade no working parts (turbines), no connections to the grid (they are there purely so the CCP can say ""we built the most""
There are millions of EV's that were built in china (just so they could say they built the most) rotting in fields.  The same for electric bikes, taxis, buses.
China is building more coal power stations in the next 20 years than were built in the last 50 by the rest of the world.
They also do not plan to start cut their co2 production until 2035 at the earliest. (unlikely as they will still be chucking new coal stations up).

And its not just the CO2 - 90%+ of the groundwater in china is unusable, FOR ANYTHING, it is too polluted.   And thru the belt and road they have exported that level of ecological destruction around the globe."
I'm pretty sure we're blowing past 1.5 very soon if we haven't already. Each MONTH we're blowing past historical records.

"Thank you so much for this video, it gives me hope ❤ Maybe it's okay to make kids in this world"
"You say “doomers” are brainwashed, but you go on and on about how we are leveling off our carbon emissions. THAT IS IRRELEVANT. There was enough CO2 in the atmosphere twenty years ago to guarantee the extinction of all complex life on this planet, so EXACTLY, SPECIFICALLY, HOW DO YOU PROPOSE WE GET BACK TO 280 OR 300 PPM, WHICH ARE THE LEVELS PRIOR TO INDUSTRIALIZATION, WITHIN 10 TO 50 YEARS? Crickets? Yeah, that’s just what we realists expected."
It bothers me how little is being spoken about nuclear energy.
Quantum computing with AI will give us all solutions weather we are willing to do it will be our greatest test.
Thank you. I really needed to hear this. Now can we solve the plastic problem?
"One technology that can help decarbonize the agriculture sector is Precision Fermentation. It uses yeast / bacteria to turn carbs into proteins / enzymes / lipids etc. It is far better for the environment than animal agriculture, and costs are forecasted to reach price parity with animal products in 2025."
"all the renewables on the planet haven't 'replaced' fossil fuels in the way people think though. it's only covered growth of energy needs.. which is nice. but, it's not like renewables chip away at existing fossil fuel use. as long as our economies are married to permanent growth we're not gonna be in a good place."
"Did you hear that above 2.5 degree, it will be a self heating hearth, whatever the humanity is doing."
"You are not going to do anything. Leaders will continue to call it racist to do anything about Asia, which contribues the most to climate change, and nothing will ever get done."
I think this video genuinely made me feel... lighter. i've been watching and experiencing so much depressing stuff and i didn't realize how much that's impacted my general mood and mental strain until i watched this. thank you.
"Love your commentary - you have a delivery style of humor that reminds me of Dr. Who's, Tom Baker, 4th Dr...   ;-)"
Great video Simon!
"Just saw your new video on Nebula, “Climate deniers…” (not yet uploaded to YouTube). I’m not a climate change denier, on the contrary.
But you cannot reasonably expect the change and the solutions to come from the top, from the government.

I’m calling for real action, not words, diplomacy (COP 999 ad infinitum and the likes) and leniency. “Climate revolution” style it’s needed. (Remember the French Revolution. When things were really bad, actual change/improvement did not come from the top, in a “civilised” manner…)
But it’s pointless, because it’s not humanity’s stringent objective apparently.
We’re content with the status quo, walking in our plastic shoes, wearing plastic clothes (yes, Simon, check the label on your purple jacket, sic.) and eating microplastics.

Until the “bottom” acts decisively we’re just going to meander pointlessly towards the event horizon of the Mad Max universe, on our Dune-like planet, hoping that maybe we’ll be able to grow at least quinoa…

P.S. If the Tobacco lobby can reverse a common sense law (see the latest retarded initiative in New Zealand, with all we know for sure about smoking) imagine what the people with the real money, i.e. Big Oil, can do.

Bottom line, let’s enjoy living on our planet, whatever the current climate situation is, while it lasts. Later on, it will get very bad, because we were lenient on decisive action when it was most needed.

Important things happen fast or they don’t happen at all."
A glimmer of hope! Yay!
"If politicians corporations don't act, then we are screwed. Individual civilians can hardly make a difference aside from carpooling, eating less red meat & not littering."
You should have gone the other way and talked about the positive side of the effects of warming.
Not good enough!  I want at least 5 C of warming by 2100!!
CROP FAILURES CROP FAILURES CROP FAILURES.   we must prepare
"Good news but if you are thinkg about nature the biggest threat to biodiversity isn't climate change but habitat loss (and also invasive species). 
Climate change is the biggest threat to humans for sure because it will ruin our economy. So that's why capitalist people are intersted in reducing it. Not to save nature. 
I'm not trying to share negativity but as a biologist I can see how people are misinformed about 'Ecology' and it would be better if everyone had the real image of the global situation and knew who should be held accountable for the destroying of the planet."
"When I hear good news, I don't think ""sick, i dont have to do anything"", i hear ""these are rookie numbers soldier we gotta get even lower"""

Really happy about the high view count for this video after the unfortunate situation you presented recently. Nice work💪

"It's sad that EU and Britain sat on there hands for the last two tech revolutions and now the only influence they can have in the world is flexing about wasting money on solar capacity and deindustrialization.

Living close to northpole i say positive. Hoping for globale warming.  Iam freecing cold up here😢😢😊
"Good stuff. I needed to hear it again. Nice to get logical, clear info without the juiced up lecture."
While I am very onboard for decarbonizing concrete production I recently learned about how these process affect the setting time and this the economics of concrete production from industry professionals. Just thought I would add some extra niche information.
Imagine if only the 1% of humanity worked to solve climate change
This video is so needed thank you thank you thank you
Im so happy to see this video has gained traction! proud of you man

"Yes, this isn’t enough, but it’s way less bad than I thought it was, so I’ll call that a win."
"As a socialist gen z People say china is bad... however, if you look at the pollution over time that adds up through out history... the Western powers have emitted far more than china ever has, and chinas pollution per capita is not as high as the Untied states! China is taking climate change seriously, and they are more than doubling their solar and wind every year! They are adding gigawatts of gigawatts, which to the point that it makes the western powers blush... let me tell you, you forgot to mention that capitalism and the free market won't save us!"
Great video Simon
"America, China & India have very little to do with controlling Global Warming. Deforestation was the biggest factor over the last 50 years.Brazil has destroyed close to 20% of The Rainforest in 50 years! That has raised the Planets temps 1.4 degrees. And that's verifiable! You will not achieve what this guy is talking about. Everything in  the ocean will die and the earth will burn up so long as we continue to allow deforestation."
As someone who lives in Nepal in mountains area it's bad for us
When the co2 line starts going down. I'll believe it
"THE problem is the energy usage keeps going up. So we aren't  actually lowering. The fossil  fuel use, we are just using all the alternative  energy on top of the fossil  fuels"
"It's hard to believe... Look, I'm from Brazil, you know? Third World. And knowing how the world works... I don't know. My region has places reaching a thermal sensation of 50ºC, water coming out of the tap very hot on the worst days, and floods (which have always been a problem) are more frequent and affect places that have never been affected before."
"According to the geologic record, soil, samples, recorded history and recently tree rings from around the world, our planet has gone through numerous periods of warming, cooling, rising/lowering oceans, greenhouse gases fluctuating, and carbon moving into the atmosphere and back many many times over the past hundreds and thousands of years. What caused that? Doesn’t matter. Humans and animals adapted. They planted gardens in Greenland. That Sahara desert was once a garden. We moved around and dealt with it. What does the UN call it when long-term shifts in weather patterns, etc. are caused by natural events, such as solar “flashes”, earth orbital changes, enormous wildfires, volcanoes, impact from outer space, etc. why can’t we call that “climate change“? The only thing we need to know is how much of the current warming are we causing? Since most of it is natural and cyclical, how much can we actually fix? That’s the only number we need. 5%? 10%? It’s egotistical of us humans to think we are so damn powerful that we can change mother nature. Ain’t happening."

Then there are people like yourself ( the low level you influencer ) who would, lets be honest, sell out his own family for a few more clicks."
"China is still burning a lot of coal. The reason why carbon emissions in the country might have peaked is also due to the fact that its economy is not growing as much as expected. Unemployment is increasing and there is also the demographic problem. Overall, their progress in renewables might have helped but we should reorganize the economy, as an alternative to constant growth. One way could be decentralize the economy, make it more local, get people used to grow their own food and discourage materialistic mentalities to end overconsumption..."

Last summer I had a picnic planned at the park and the weather man said it was going to rain so I canceled the picnic and it turned out to be sunny.  Then you know who was at the park laughing?  the weather.  He wanted to party at the park himself that day and then lied about the weather.  Watch climate change is going to be just like that.
Comment
Climate is a closed loop system. When things break it is not linear the way it breaks. Its amplified. And it ramps _fast_.
We will all be dead in 100 years so it won't matter
"Climate change has nothing to do with CO2 emissions. It has to do with the precession of the earth axis. We are entering the turn around phase (which lasts 300-500 years roughly), so the climate will change regardless of EV""s, or other CO2 reduction technology. Time for people to wake up from this nonsense."
"Scientists are complete failures at getting their message out , need to hire advertising firm to get message out"
"Who would have thought that exceptionally high solar activity and a warm weather phenomenon would lead to warmer temperatures?  Shocking!   Since it's expected to end by spring and temperatures have been much warmer in the Earth's history prior to the Ice Age (past 2.6 million years)  and there were multiple glacial (cold) times as well as interglacial (warm) times during the ice age which are not completely understood; should scientists express ""alarm"" about an uncertainty?   Nature has survived the previous glacial and interglacial times, but nuclear waste and microplastics and all of the other toxic waste created by humans wasn't a factor....  is the warmer weather really the problem?   ☢☣⚠    
Fortunately, if the ""so-called AMOC"" does shift and create cooler conditions, global warming shouldn't be such an issue, especially since other warming factors change as well."
We are doomed then because no matter what - if there is war there will be oil and if there is oil there will be global warming.

"Come on DW, this is pretty pathetic scare mongering. How about some professional journalism?"
There is nothing significantly practical that can be done to reduce CO2 emissions. So it's time to stop complaining and blaming and just use geoengineering.

"Dark matter phase transitions could be a primary climate driver. If the solar system passes through an area of higher liquid dark matter content the planets cores would all receive more heat due to increased phase transitions thus heating the earth from the inside out.

Heating of the planet from the inside out would result in :
Increased ground temperatures 
Increased sea temperatures
Increased nighttime temperatures 
Increased seismic activity 
Increased earthquakes

"The title says new climate date shows global temperatures continuing to rise sharply. Only did i not see any data on climate change and i did not see how do they aquire this data. All i see is people talking about data, but we do not see the actual data and how they got the data, how did they measure it, how did they come to their conclusion? Now i believe the climate changes, just as it has been changing in different ways and forms for over 5 billion years, and now the climate has been warming up for over 12000 years, that period is called the end of the last ice age. So it started long before humans industrialized. People worry about carbon in the atmosphere, they should know that only 0,04% of earths atmosphere exists oit of carbon. If that number drops below 0,02% then that would mean the end of all plant life on the planet because trees and plants feed on carbon. It is strange these climate alarmists and climate ""scientists"" never show you that data. As long as they tell you that you should buy this and that to save the climate then that is nothing more then commercial sales trick."

"Of course CO2 continues to rise, because when an area of emissions is reduced, the Government claims a credit, and then sells that on to big business (CO2 emitters) in order for them to scale up their operations, emitting the usual (plus the credit) without penalty.

We rather have war and hatred against each other than unify as species and do something magnificent for the better future of our planet and future humans😢
Dont believe state media news
We live in a dictatorship of the 1%
So you mean to tell me all the nuclear weapons test into the oceans hasn't contributed to global warming?
"Dude the 1.5 happened during a la niña, so no el niño wasn't a factor. It will be for 2024 tho"
The planet will be here for much longer than us. It will recover when humans have destroyed themselves. Live your life!
King Canute couldn't do it
It’s way too late to stop global warming. It should have implemented 75 years ago to make a difference. Slow pain collapse is a mathematical certainty.
We are just closer to the sun.
"Nuclear the answer, but sadly after a half century the uptake for fission reactor has been very slow, and they are still pushing the same reactor design type, the one that makes radioactive ghost towns☢️👻🏘 when things go wrong and 20,000 years of stewardship for radioactive waste when things go right. If we had a safer reactor design people would be less likely to reject a Proposed reactor near their neighbourhood, and if you could drop the number of years of stewardship of radioactive waste down to only 300 years even better. The right fission reactor design seems to be Thorium Molten Salt Reactors, sadly the only government that has encouraged building a Thorium Molten Salt Reactor is china 🇨🇳 the rest of the world seems to be putting red tape and roadblocks in the way of this important technology for over 50 years."

"Media Nonsense. As recent as 70’s we were told an ice age is coming. Then the same people in 80’s threaten us oil would be run out in 20 years.  When both hoaxes failed, they start to scare us by global warming nonsense."
No mention of the single biggest cause of climate collapse..ongoing Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering and the UVC  now hitting the earth from a declining ozone layer. These omissions make this report useless.
"In the supermarkets in europe I see so much use of plastics and foam for packaging of everything. A pack of biscuit will have a outer plastic wrapper, then a hard plastic shell inside, and then again small plastic wrap for each pair of biscuits. Same goes for many other things. Are there any restrictions imposed on how much packaging is too much?"

Its Russia's fault if you stop them the issue will go away.

And the only thing that help to cool down are trees but they cut them down for “Renewable” energy. It takes 25 years to regrow !!!! and one power plant use 625 ton per day! That are 416 trees just burned for “clean” energy 🤮. You can better use oil/gas/Coal and plant new trees to absorb CO2. Wake UP people.
"The question i wanna leave humanity behind: did your wealth save your car,house,and belongings from an angry planet?"
"Co2 is 0.04% of the atmosphere, and is If the Earth's temperature were to rise by 1.4°C over the next 100 years, that would be an average increase of 0.014°C per year...

So each year they want to waste billions and reduce all living standar to reduce the average temp with 0.014°C by fighting a weak gass that is 0.04% of the atmosphere... And that gass would not even rise the climate with 0.014°C if it was 0.08 of the atmosphere even..."
1.5C is meaningless. It was pulled out of a hat. There is no scientific relevance. Life flourishes under warming.
"The simplest physics to understand is that ice that melts will continue to melt until it gets colder. The earth will not get colder for several thousand years, no matter how fast we reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. As long as the permafrost thaws, new greenhouse gases will continue to be added to the atmosphere. The world will get warmer. Physical fact."
"Global temps have been rising since the late 1600's when we had a mini ice age.  In fact 95% of earths history has been warmer than it is currently.........it's a scam people, wake up"
"Earth is cooler w atmos/WV/30% albedo not warmer.
Ubiquitous GHE heat balance graphics don’t + violate LoT.
Kinetic heat transfer processes of contiguous atmos molecules render surface BB impossible.

So what if temperatures rise? Just wear shorts
"The humans are the Fifth Race or creation, the first were the Titans, and Giants way too big, and what happens in/on Earth is not humans fault, as humans can only influence part of the processes of Earth, fortunatly."
The answer is right in front of us in the form of nuclear power.
I’m not worried about the planet it has been here for millions of years and many more. World population will naturally shrink in the years to come and development of new technology will always improve as it has been for decades. Stop all the doom and gloom and start looking after each other.

"Contrary to our dear ""expert"", ""the main drivers"" of climate collapse and global heating are fossil fuel burning and increasing heat energy release: the heat equivalent of 1,149,120 Hiroshima yield nuclear bomb blasts (@63 trillion BTUs each!) PER DAY.     All this baloney about CO2 is a far less important contributor, but a real distraction for the fossil fuel industry to keep us ignoring the heat generation existential threat to all life on the planet.   In fact, the 1 trillion tons of evaporating water vapor rising from overheated oceans daily is the most significant GHG!   ""Don't look up!""."
Canadians are paying a carbon tax.  I'm sure everything will be fine..

Winter snow seasons are getting very very short.
Important to note that people blaming everyone are also very wrong. Many politicians (especially left wing ones) advocate for change but you need to reach 50% in every single body for your legislation to go through. That's the actualy reason progress happens incredibly slowly. What you can do is vote for social liberal parties.
One must be careful whe interpreting statistical results. Every statistical model has its assumptions. We must judge the results of an investigation with a thorough and rigorous analysis. We can't depend on a biased researcher or journalist.
There is a direct link between thoses who has the wealth is who contributes the most to c02 climate change
It's funny how the politicians that call for climate change are the ones flying in private jets everywhere and the ones that own high-emitting while they expect the average Joe who's barely making ends meet to cut down get rid of his gas card and go by a 60 plus thousand dollar electric vehicle is that when it breaks down it costs more than the gas car.

Paint medium strips white. each adult to plant 5000 trees per year or your tax rates goes to 50%. each company must plant 50,000 trees per year or your tax rate goes to 60%. plant trees along east west facing roads to shade them. plant trees in cities. Create giant seaweed farms, regreen deserts, there is pumped hydro, Concentrated solar thermal, riding bikes, walking, grow your own food, protest, write to your local member of government, make science compulsory in all schools, stop all new coal and gas projects. Stop watching the media they are lying to you. its all possible you just have to stop playing the VICTIUM to corporate greed. thats 1% of people you curtailing too. there is more of us than there is of them.

"Every time I see something about a nuclear phase out program I die a little inside. It doesn't have the same toxic byproducts as biofuel, natural gas, and coal.

A tempest in a teapot.
Global warming is part of a natural cycle and these cycles cannot be stopped. Huge amounts of money is being spent on a problem that doesn't exist.
Climate change is a great discussion but nobody ever talks about why are they (terraforming) our  planet????
"I am from Germany and the denial of man-made climate change (mainly by right-wing extremists, conservatives and liberals) is a major social and political problem! The fact that oil companies continue to make huge profits in these times but refuse to take any responsibility for the consequences is shocking. Nobody wants to change anything, the motto is: keep it up! Let others take the first step. Climate activists are branded as terrorists, while the super-rich still get tax breaks! Find the mistake."
"climate is changing, but you cant do anything with this, stop blaming people, stop blaming CO2,stop blaming population growth. Its useless."
y las pootencias entre ellas alemania arrojando toneladas de explosivos!!!! no deberían ser declarados TERRORISTAS? en pro de la vida del planeta!!!
"so what? Now it has melted, in 10 years it will freeze again. stop panicking, there are warming-freezing cycles"
"""climate change""? it used to be called ""global warming"".........climate change happens four times every year in most of countries around world. that is called spring,summer,autumn and winter. without these climate change, nobody can survive. the key point is that the climate change caused by human activity or not. my view is not."

"Premises are the proof. Circular thinking. The new New.

"Nothing will change UNTIL every act of consumption INCLUDES the full cost of all activities involved, and those added costs are actually used to repair the damages they were collected to cover.

Capitalism in its current form does not do this. The alternatives don't do any better. A modified form of economics is required, one which charges the logger for the original value of the live tree, and the car driver for the emissions of the exhaust, the loss of the forests to produce palm oil, rubber, adhesives, paint additives etc etc."
CO 2 is not the problem.  Unelected representatives and commercial interests have hijacked peoples shallow sympathies.  Where is the money going.? How much money has Al Gore made? This is all to frighten the masses and is a bait and swtch exercise.

"All lies just to raise taxes and benefit certain corporations. 
Do we really think we can stop cosmic/planetary cycles? :D We nee to prepare to act against ice age, not the opposite."
Instead of global warming the evidence points to a ice age like this is the coldest winter in Huntington Beach in history it's rain for weeks
I'm not a scientist but it seems to me that Global Warming is just a natural cycle of the Earth. It's not like our education and technology has been around long enough time to record the Earth's climate changes since it's birth.
Enough of this climate change nonsense. This emperor is naked.
"Climate change will happen as IT did many times in earths history, whether you want IT or not. No matters what you do nothing is going to reverse it.

"174 years of climate data? Really? Give me a break. We didn’t even have a weather satellite until the 1970s. 100 years ago (1924) climatology was barely in its infancy – sporadic at best. 170 years ago (1854) few thermometers were widely available, and fewer yet were accurately calibrated. So don’t try to tell us you have accurate climate data from 174 years ago."

"For more climate change videos, check out our playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5eNh88rkSNQonaKMKjT-P6h"
"Yes, but big extensions took place during thousands of years, it was gradual, it leaves time for species to adapt and survive . But it’s been only 200 years. This change is way too fast for our planet to handle without our help. I saw no one point this out and I think it is really important because it ruins the entire message of the video."
We still aren't dead. Hoax!
Thanks Mrs. Obvious. 🙄
"It’s a good video, but I am bothered by the stark lack of what impact climate change will have on the broader global biodiversity. Too many species of already vulnerable plant and animal will genuinely go extinct within this century - that’s one of the things I focus on in this subject, big time."
Award to this crew for a beautifully succinct survey of our context and what does and doesnt apply to the current conversation. Heck yeah!
🐶hi Vox (you don't have to do a Q&A video but) do you think you're a good person? if so do you think there's an afterlife? also i'm not better than anybody else.
Greta tweeted in 2018 that we had five years left before climate catastrophe....now its 2023 and nothing has changed. You're going to have to accept that you don't matter and you don't affect the climate.
this aged well
Humanidade é perdulária
why is this video so short
"You, you, you're good you!"
I think the creators of the video should learn that the higher number in population is normal and it doesn’t effect the climate as long as the humans living is sustainable.
"This video is amazing, would love to watch a whole documentary about this topic."
"This is the reason why ""humans will be the end of earth."""
Its a good point. People say we can't afford to make changes. Climate change is already costing us a lot with fires and hurricanes. The planet will still be here long after we are gone.
"its true ,,the discovery of fire was mankinds' original sin . however where combustible fuels have been most used  life spans have more than doubled , agricultural production soared ,famine disappeared , poverty diminished , education increased , deaths from natural disasters plummeted , and all the advances of modern life in transportation and electronics proliferated ."

Evolution is a lie
When you’re so wrong about global warming that you have to rebrand the concept.
Wow.
We even have plastic pollution
"I don't think we're going to get a hold of this problem, and I think human civilization deserves to become extinct. Never has a species enacted so much cruelty on everything around it despite its own knowledge of morality."
"By why does it have to be a bad thing, what if there are some benefits? Even NASA said the Earth is getting greener from carbon dioxide. We can focus on reversing desertification, we have made huge strides there. It doesn't always have to be apocalyptic drama."
"That's the beuty of human nature
Caring for themselves 'selfishness'.
But choosing to not make themselves at stake ,but instead they're surroundings.

Humans are truly amusing seeking truth but yet instead given lies.
Falling into a hole of candies,but all given diabetes. 
Gaining pleasure,but seek to torment identities."
It reminds me Jurassic Park
The current stable plateau of weather/seasons/climate is something that doesn't get talked about enough.

"Climate change is not new to the earth, it’s new to us (in the last 10000 years)."
"the ""scientific method "" used in determining that humans are the main driver for climate change has proven to be false. One way to validate a hypothesis is through predictions and not one prediction has come to pass. Another way is through repeatable experiments and that hasn't been applied to validate their hypothesis. So far nothing has been proven beyond the normal warming trend since the last mini ice age."
The very last sentence... Something that the human race has never seen before. Let that sink in.
"Vox: mammals evolved from reptiles

Adam and Eve: are we a joke to you?"
Oh Yeah? Re sea level rise? How come the woke Obamas paid $15million for a waterfront property in summer 2019? Please explain.

That’s a great way of putting it. Good job!
The planet will survive climate change. Humans most likely will not. Our best bet right now is hope the elites have mercy on us and stop destroying the environment exponentially. Our time is coming to a close.

Thank you so much Vox for making videos such as this.
"I applaud the message .Global warming is an urgent and worsening crisis for us humans and many other living species. But how were global temperatures over the past 140,000 years determined. What are the error bars on the measurements. The graph shows remarkably stable temperatures for the past 10,000 years. Why?"
The world wont end we will. The world will get hotter and cooler and when a new apex species evolves the same thing will happen to them
"I still think it's something that we should not do to the world. There are so so many bad things in our relationship with nature and the animal kingdome. We shouldn't pollute the ocean with plastic, we should've  make animals go extinct, we should pollute the atmosphere by cutting trees, we shouldn't harm the ground  by planting only one thing in it and most of all we shouldn't  eat animals that were massively and artificially  produced."
like duh?!
"How are we to know the destiny of humanity, those who have the means should follow their drive, but the back seat drivers need to shut up"
"Climate change was always natural, how do you think the ice ages happened and ended so many times?
Of course i'm not saying we shouldn't care, i'm saying everyone is freaking out about something that is not that urgent.
Every year countries and people invest money on organizations that promise to change it, but the only way to change it of course is healthier enviroment, such as reflorestation and scientific research to find useful, more organic solutions."
"Please buy hybrids and EV's thanks, 👍"
"The thing about Earth is that it's always changing, and when one thing is changing another thing is affected. The thing with climate change is that Earth is always changing and we're going to be greatly affected so we're preventing this change. We were so well adapted with what we already have that we can't be bothered to start all over again. This is also the reason why we are keeping our current wildlife away from extinction, it's because we're afraid of change. This also why when searching for life, we're only taking notice of planets that are similar to us since we can't imagine a world different from us. There are two things that we can do and one thing to do is be ready to adapt to change and evolve instead of sticking with the past and not learn. Though I think when we accept that things will change, we're also bound to be heavily affected, and might go extinct, and that's a good enough reason to prevent these changes from happening, which is why that would be our second option. In the end it's either we stick with our old ways out let go of the past and be ready to face change."

climate change is still gonna effect other animal and plant species and it humans fault
End of the fourth world is coming.
Wait...!!! I thought the earth was flat...
"Stop fussing about 2°.. 4°.. of Climate Change! Let's do something to make our fossil fuel power plants and energy infrastructure ""Carbon Neutral"" NOW! We have the technology and resources to do that, all we need is  'Collective OpenMinded Will' to do it!"
Yes it is this is very serious stop sticking your heads in the sand it won't just go away
Earth has never had an ideal climate for humans. Hence why we live indoors.
"Climate change is a problem to our world also, but thats not the point. The point is that we need to stabilize the change."
Force = mass * acceleration heats the planet. Chemistry is just a byproduct.
"Actually, the magnetic poles are beginning to reverse. So, maybe we should expect some really unusual weather patterns.  Right? Have 1 child per couple and reduce emissions by 50%"
"Plus, if the Earth were not warming from climate change right now, the Earth would actually be in a state of cooling. There have been several ""mini Ice Ages"" over the past couple centuries to indicate that the average temperature was on the decline."
"The description in the video is flawed.
Yes, Climate change is not new. But human-induced artificial climate change is new.
Yes, Life has always survived in the past. But For the first time, we are polluting the planet to an extent where recovery will be hampered.
No animal species ever has changed the planet to suit it better. We have been doing so since agriculture.
No species ever tried to escape the planet before climate change. We are for the first time now."
"Thank you Vox.  This is a discussion I’ve been having for years regarding human impact on our ecosystem. It’s like we are all collectively pooping in our own drinking water and then arguing over whether we are cause of it becoming undrinkable.  What we are doing is self limiting. The earth will survive and life will continue to thrive, albeit in another form that has adapted to a warmer climate, what we do to it after we have been eliminated by our own design, or by Mother Nature."
"I submit mankind has yet to discover many, many unknown influences to 'Climate Change' that will prove the futility of man-made efforts to change it."
Well Said
What *Americans* get wrong...
"Yes, but don't forget about the Holocene extinction. (Species going extinct at 10x the normal rate, which will also skyrocket due to climate change). Yes a good chunk of life will survive, but at what cost?"
"""THaT's nOt ReaLlY tHe RiGht wAy tO ThINk abOuT iT."""
Your evolutionary explanation is very inaccurate.
"Fighting climate change is more about saving humans than saving the environment, which would evolve in any case."
"We're not at the mercy of climate anymore. If we can't grow food in one area, we will grow food in another. We have people that thrive in 120º deserts and people that live in -50º permafrost. Humans, despite being weak and frail are not only an apex predator, but a ""superpredator"" for a good reason."
i dont agree with this facts. archeologists have found civilizations that have been on this earth tens of thousands  years ago and had technologies that we dont have till this date.
soundtrack??? Anyone.....
"In 1968 Paul R. Ehrlich published the ""Population Bomb"" .  It warned of catastrophe in the 1970s and 1980s because the earth's natural resources would not keep up with population growth.  At the time he wrote the book the earth's population was estimated at about 3.5 billion people.   Today we have an estimated 7.6 billion people and a growing middle class Asia which use to be very poor.  No catastrophe from population growth.  Ditto for global warming.

History tells us ""Don't worry be happy""."
You should do a video on the Anthropocene
"One very specific piece of data is left of of every graph.. Margin of error.... Margin of error in ""global average"" 3 degrees c..... The supposed increase is within the margin of error.. 

Some minor data not shown.. Is that predictions about a 3 degree rise 30 years ago had it happening by the year 2000... But it didn't happen...

Also. A minor piece of data... The name change from global warming, to climate change. Because the planet wants actually warming.. They are trying to us a natural phenomenon to scare us into thinking we are killing our selves. But since they are losing the fight.. Now they are saying it's not the planet... It just us.... Thats in danger."
"Let us assume the earth is warming (it is) and it is caused by human activity and that in the absence anything being done we all die, animals die, plants die. At that point human intervention stops and nature takes over. How is the earth going to recover? The forests  have been reduced so they cannot soak up CO2, will they ever grow again if wild fires keep reducing them and no humans to fight them. Sure the earth will not self destruct, but it is the actions of the corporations who are afraid of losing money that is preventing the action required. 30 or more years ago scientists told us they had found DDT in penguin eggs, in the Antarctic. No one said ""we don't believe you"" we just stopped using DDT."
global warming is a chinese conspiracy. Donald Trump is right !
"I wonder how can we know certain temperature of past 200 000 years, since humans are able to measure temperature for about 0,15% of it's existence (200k years). And the data of just certain locations (which aren't very accurate as for the whole earth's temperature) are there for even less of time. The video is great though."
"Good video but it is also about saving the thousands of others species that humans depend on for survival. If ecosystems fail, we fail."
"Yeah tell that to a creationist. They will never believe you so therefore to them this video is as pointless as hair growing on a men's back. I mean to them all those fossils fuel we use were put on earth by god for us use and don't tell them the earth is more that 6,000 years they will call it a blasphemy. How do we teach creationism someone as to pretend to talk on god's behalf him/herself. Simple."

"Interesting. Never thought in this way before. We are the one who lives on the earth, and now earth is changing her own body temperature while we are worrying about her instead of thinking what could the change bring to us."
0:55 wait wut. Where did we get this? How do we know this?
That background cello music is pretty sweet.
out of all the climate change films i've seen & things I've read this was the best I've seen. In that in just 2:45 minutes you produced such a clear message of the key problem that everyone should hear & know.
"No.  A. They used data for 150 thousand years when we have over 450 thousand years of data showing a specific pattern, NOTHING unusual about where we are right now. And B. There is no conclusive study showing that carbon emissions are drastically affecting the temperature in the way that many claim. And C. These projections are based off of cherry picking data, and making claims that aren't backed by concrete studies."
And bears! dón't forget the bears u__u
Earth is just a rock in space. It doesn't care about us or anything happening on its surface. We need to stop climate change to save ourselves.
That's not entirely true. Current trends suggest life might not be able to evolve rapidly enough to keep up with global warming.
"This is the best explanation of Climate Change I have ever seen. It makes it clear what the risks are for civilisation if we fail to take climate change seriously. It's not about saving the planet, it's about us and our vulnerability to a level of climate disruption civilisation has never seen."
"am in  LOVE with  JOSS FONG, what an intelligent   woman"
"The sheer number of people who still say '""Climate change is a hoax"" is astounding. And to think of it, these are the ones that claim who complain that the days are getting hotter/colder by the day."
"Forget the term climate change. No one can deny that our air, water, & lands are polluted. Over 100,000 people die a year in China due to air pollution! No one can deny that animals are going extinct, forests are depleting, the ice is melting, & we have piles on piles of trash, unused goods, & wasted food!!! Forget climate change.. we are abusing our earth!! Point blank."

"The timing is right in some points, although I would add the civilization ""We know"" started 12.000 years ago, but is egocentric and naive to believe that in the millions years the earth has existed only ""our"" civilization flourished in the past 0.0001% of its time existence. Huge climate changes probably destroyed previous ways of life and eventually will do the same with ours. We are just accelerating the process."
"It's amusing reading the comments from the deniers on this thread.  You see, there is ONLY  one political body on this entire planet that wholesale denies the science of climate change.  ONLY ONE.  That political body is called the GOP.  Thus, they have taken a POLITICAL POSITION, not a scientific one. So, it's quite clear that if you're a denier you are taking a political position, too, not a scientific one.

That makes you ignorant.

Your political position of denial and ignorance doesn't trump the entire planet.  Period.  You are a fool if you continue to front your anti-science stance.  We are laughing at you because of it, too."
"The truth is,
The Planet will survive.
Humans will also survive,
just not most of them.

The planet will not kill most of us,
We will kill each other to survive.

Food, shelter, water will become more expansive than most people can afford.
And that, is the beginning of the end."
"Has anybody looked at the Sun as a cause of Climate Change? It's not that Climate Change is not happening. I'm sure it has changed and will continue to change while this planet still spins. We should do all we can to protect the environment. Lets not pave the earth over for a new WalMart. 
And lets not forget about how leaders and nations lie to themselves and their people to get their way. I'm tired of being told that it's all my fault the planet is going to fry. Why all the doom and gloom? Why dose every problem the human race faces will only end in our destruction? We're being scared to death so much we don't care anymore why we're going to die. The moment I hear someone talking about climate change, I tune them out. Don't want to hear it. Ok, we're doomed. Maybe the dogs or the roaches will have better luck."

"I am delivering a sermon to you 🙏😊 please read

Consistently Pray for forgiveness, guidance in a good (positive) direction, and for help against evil. Pray to be saved from hell  (whatever that may be). Pray for your friends and your family too, it only takes a minute or so/less at a time to pray. Do it and your life will slowly get better, or maybe quickly. It probably just depends on you and the kind of person you are/have been. Don't wait until its too late and you have to suffer the consequences of built up bad karma from immoral acts/unrepented sins. Maybe together we can help make the world a better place by changing ourselves for the better, and changing things around us for the better.
And addressing/thanking the CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD at the beginning and end of your prayers would be a good idea.
Be my friend and I will pray for you, but I do not know how much help me doing so will give you. You should try to practice daily prayer yourself.
I'm trying to help you get right with the LORD 🙏

Amen.

I have worded a short prayer for you to say if you are not sure what words to use, it may not be the best but here it is 😊

''   CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD,
Please forgive me and my friends and my family for our immoral acts, please help guide us in a positive direction and please help us against evil. Please save us from Hell and have mercy on our souls. Thank you for everything CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD. Amen.  ''

Please say this at least once a day for at least a month, do it longer if you want to and can 🙏

You should prostrate yourself if you don't want to do spoken prayer, or do both 🙏😊 Please worship the LORD GOD and not any idol. 

Please put your hands together 🙏 bow your head and say this prayer:
""CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD, please know that I worship you and not any idols. Thank you for everything CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD. Amen""

Say '  Om Namah Shivaya  ' or '  Om Namo Bhagavate Rudraya  ' out loud or in your head 108 times, or try to do it 1008 times 😊 try to do it everyday if you want

repeat this aloud for as long as you want to, try to do it for like an hour a day or say it in a prayer  ""Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner""

You can also say this prayer once a day or repeat it aloud as many times as you would like to:
""Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen.""

Galatians 6:7-8
""Do not be deceived, GOD is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to the flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life.“ 

Thessalonians 5:16-18
""Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.""

Philippians 4:6-7
""Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.""

""O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for us, I trust in You!""   Repeat this aloud at least 3 times or as many as you want, do it everyday if you can 

I apologize for all the words 😊 I know how it may look

If you can't remember the words to any prayer, pray them as you read them if you cannot look and remember them 🙏 please consider beginnning daily prayer, it is a good habit that will help you if you do it and continue to do it. Don't just read from the Book! Actually practice daily prayer, the most fundamental part of religion (or one of the most fundamental parts). What would any Holy Book be without regular prayer? It will actually help you! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"

"Many climate experts, while cautiously welcoming the reference to fossil fuels in the agreement, point to serious weaknesses, including leaving the door open for fossil fuel expansion to continue.

Harjeet Singh, the head of global political strategy at nonprofit Climate Action Network International, said “after decades of evasion, COP28 finally cast a glaring spotlight on the real culprits of the climate crisis: fossil fuels. A long-overdue direction to move away from coal, oil, and gas has been set.”

But, he added, “the resolution is marred by loopholes that offer the fossil fuel industry numerous escape routes, relying on unproven, unsafe technologies.”

His reference is to the controversial technology known as carbon capture and storage — a set of techniques being developed to pull carbon pollution from polluting facilities such as power plants and from the air, and store it underground. The agreement calls for an acceleration of the technology.

Many scientists have expressed concern that carbon capture is unproven at scale, a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuel use and too expensive.

Some countries and experts were alarmed by the agreement’s recognition of a role for “transitional fuels” in the energy transition — largely interpreted to mean natural gas, a planet-heating fossil fuel."
"The world agreed to a new climate deal in Dubai on Wednesday at the COP28 summit after two weeks of painstaking talks, making an unprecedented call to transition away from fossil fuels, but using vague language that could allow some countries to take minimal action.

The gavel went down on the agreement, known as the Global Stocktake, in the morning after the talks were pushed into overtime by marathon negotiations between countries bitterly divided over the future role for oil, gas and coal."
Oh yeah sure agreeing then forgotten it and ignoring it the next day were not stupid you guys keep saying this for years now but nothing change
And how many people will expire due to the fact that they do not have these resources because that's what this is about culling the herd.
"Renewable energy and EVs are such a joke.  Renewables only work in small areas and even then they are not really that clean.  EVs are dirtier than fossil fuel cars and fossil fuel is dirtier than hybrid.  Look at the whole picture, not just while it is driving down the road."
If only CNN would also give the whole context that  the deal they made actually does not provide detailed instructions on how they will actually step away from Fossil fuels and said president also owns oil companies
"With the exception of nuclear energy, there is no other reliable form of energy other than possible fuel. One of our progressive networks within the last day or two announced government approval of a new nuclear power generator to be built in Tennessee. The world has learned that weather dependent greed energy to include wind and solar is unreliable, expensive, and cannot provide nameplate energy consistently. We can find no other country that more robustly embraced weather dependent green energy than Germany, we now see German industry fleeing because of the high price of energy and most Europeans have now had to crawl in bed with Putin to take advantage of his natural gas pipelines.
   We see all of the massive trucks lined up to bring humanitarian aid into Palestine and Gaza. Fortunately, all of these huge trucks operate on gas or diesel fossil fuel energy."
"😂 here we go again 
Make believe climate change caused by humans and fossil fuels. Climate change is just as irrelevant as it was 30 or 40 years ago. It was a take home idea for politicians to gather votes out of fear"
We are so stupid to believe politicians. Man made climate change doesn't exist. The ones that purpurate  such a ridiculous concept just do it for power. Real scientists have refuted almost all the climate change myths.
These are the people that use up the most fossil fuels

So I was doing a bit of studying the other day and the idea of the bering land bridge came up which is scientifically accepted to have formed and melted countless times throughout the history of planet Earth. My question is that if vehicle and industrial co2 pollution is causing the seas to rise and glaciers to melt like they tell us...then was it vehicle and industrial co2 pollution which caused previous climate changes and glacial melting tens of thousands of years ago? And before that? And before that? And before that? And if so...is it then quite possible that we just haven't dug deep enough to find evidence of these ancient vehicles and technologies?

"It is a scientific fact that CO2 emissions are heavier than air. The lightest of all bird feathers are heavier than air. They might be blown all over the earth, but they do not rise into the stratosphere! The methane emitted by cows and humans are short lived and are filtered out through the air. 
The sun emits many gasses including carbon. So what was the cause of global warming that spelled the end of the so called Ice-Age; where a lot of the ice covering the earth, melted away leaving the north and south Ice caps? That is, apart from the top of high mountains?"
How do you think the better to rescue???
"Climate change is a big LIE, the climate has always changed.  What created the Ice Ages and what melted them?  Only 10,000 years ago Britain was mainly covered in ice, and suddenly the temperature rose and melted it, creating the landscape we know now.  No plains, trains, cars, industry etc!  We should do our best in a measured and steady way to clean up our act - mainly on pollution, but there is no need to panic.  All these activists and celebrities who are promoting this ‘global warming/climate change’ scenario are just doing it out of their need to be ‘seen’."

Bullshit bbc
"The UN's IPCC AR6 report: Earth warming, it's CO2, man is the reason for the increase in CO2, it's not the sun.

Also, an increase in energy of a system definitely changes that system. It is impossible that weather events are the same, and with more energy we know that extreme weather events are more likely. This is pretty much common sense, even if your paycheck comes from oil."
Another piece of climate propaganda from Auntie Beeb.
"The UN's IPCC AR6 report, chapter 11 'Weather and Climate Extreme Events in a Changing Climate' summarises the fact that certain severe weather events cannot be detected as increasing, nor attributed to human caused climate change:
Pages 1761 - 1765, Table 11.A.2 Synthesis table summarising assessments
Heavy Precipitation: 24 out of 45 global regions low confidence in observed trend (12 medium confidence), 43 out 45 low confidence in human attribution. 
Agricultural Drought: 31 out of 45 global regions low confidence in observed trend 
(14 medium confidence. No high confidence assessment). 42 out 45 low confidence in human attribution (3 medium, no high confidence). 
Ecological Drought as above.
Hydrological Drought: 38 out of 45 global regions low confidence in observed trend. 
43 out 45 low confidence in human attribution (2 medium confidence, no high confidence)."
"The UN's IPCC AR6, chapter 12 ""Climate Change Information for Regional Impact and for Risk Assessment"", section 12.5.2, table 12.12 confirms there is a lack of evidence or no signal that the following have changed: 
Air Pollution Weather (temperature inversions), Aridity,

"When it comes to fires, Global burned area has decreased by one quarter this century! The World is burning less.
For the whole of Canada, there is no trend in burn acreage for the period 1980-2021. The previous highest burn acreage was in 1989. Over that same period the trend for number of fires was slightly downwards (CNFDB). Note that 2020 had the lowest recorded burn acreage and number of fires, so can that record be attributed to man-made climate change? 
Burn acreage was much, much, higher in the US during the 1920's, 30's and 40's. It peaked in 1930 at well over 50,000,000 acres. The trend is downwards (1926-2020 NIFC US) eventhough CO2 has increased exponentially. For 2000 onwards the average burn acreage is much less than 10,000,000 acres. The number of fires has also declined. Remember CO2 was increasing all the time. Burn area for US in 2023 was 3rd lowest on record. It was under 3 million acres well below the ten year average of 7 million and the lowest since 1998 (NIFC).
Data for Siberia seems harder to come by. However, for the period 1997-2016, the trend was highly variable (by a factor of 4) but the trend for the annual burn acreage was downwards (Global Fire Data). 
For the Amazon (2003-2019), 2010 was the record year for fire emissions with all subsequent years lower by at least ½.
When it comes to wildfires there was nothing unusual about 2023 summer's fire season in Europe (look it up on the EFFIS website). Besides all this the forest fire record in Southern Europe is related to the previous winter rains, not summer temperatures. Wetter winters encourage more plant grow, which forms more fuel for fires when it dries out. Mediterranean summers are always hot and dry enough to allow fires to spread. 
Furthermore, with regard to the IPCC, they have not detected or attributed the number of fires or the burn acreage to man-made climate change. Also IPCC only has medium confidence ( that's a 50-50, so toss a coin) that weather conditions that promote wildfires (fire weather) have become more probable in southern Europe, northern Eurasia, the USA, and Australia over the last century. Note that annual Global Wildfire Carbon Emissions have been declining dramatically since 2003, with 2022 being the lowest on record (Copernicus).
""With higher CO2, increased tree cover leads to reduced fire ignition and burned area, and provides a positive feedback to tree cover"" (Chen et al, 2019), so burning fossil fuels actually leads to less forest fire!
Global burned area has decreased by nearly by 24.2% in 20 years (Chen et al, 2023).
The World is burning less!
There is no climate crisis...there isn't even any evidence for it."
"The famine in the Horn of Africa is endemic not because of climatic factors but because of bad governance and poverty. If you compare these regions to the Gulf States, the climate of the Gulf is similar, although even drier, but the latter have a much higher standard of living due their wealth of fossil fuels and better social organisation. What the Horn of Africa needs is a good dose of reliable energy from fossil fuels to raise their living standards."
"Pakistan Floods: area flooded 8%, much of this short term. 2010 floods were worse. Both associated with La Niña phase during a Northern Hemisphere summer - a natural phenomenon. There is no connection to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. August 1961 was wetter. For Pakistan's annual rainfall totals the 7-year moving average has barely changed since the 1980s, fluctuating up and down, but with no long term trend. Pakistan has endured major floods long before any significant rise in CO2. Since 1850 Pakistan has experienced 7 major droughts and 6 major floods. Since 1880 there is no trend in excess rainfall or drought conditions over the greater Indian region.
I might add the people of Pakistan are also suffering from poverty, bad governance and uncontrolled population growth. In addition in the immediate future they will suffer from the perverse environmental policies of Developed countries that have decided to stop extracting their own energy resources, but will consume the rest of the world's, outbidding poorer countries, like Pakistan, consigning them to darkness and further poverty."

"If you took away El Niño, a record increase in Total Solar Irradiance, and the Tonga eruption (all natural events) there would have been nothing to see in 2023. 
The Tonga eruption injected 142 megatonnes of water vapour into the stratosphere, increasing its water content by 15%. Water vapour is a far more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2. 
Total solar irradiance: satellite data from 1979 onwards shows June 2023 at an all time high in over 40 years of measurements (ncei.noaa). There were lows below 1361 W/m² in 2019 to current highs over 1362 W/m² in June (using a lowess curve, which also shows the fastest rate of increase during this recent period). So we are looking at a change of around 1½ Watts over the course of 5 years (the maximum difference is 2.1W/m²). That may not sound much but it exceeds the increase in the Earth's Energy Imbalance (0.9 W/m², 2018 - 1.97 W/m², 2023) (NASA CERES EBAF TOA). Overall the current increase in solar irradiance should give a direct global heating effect of +0.1°C, with an indirect effect of +0.2°C (after Schmutz, 2021). This increase in solar irradiance is related to an earlier than expected increase in sunspot activity, which has not yet reached its zenith, and that may not happen for several years (Royal Observatory Belgium), so further heating from this cause can be expected."
"Everything we do releases carbon dioxide, so the Carbon Cult want to control everything. There will be global starvation if fossil fuels are eliminated. At risk in coming decades will be half of the world’s 8.5 billion to 10 billion people who are fed by crops grown with fertilizers derived from fossil fuels. Getting to Net Zero by 2050 would cost $9.2 trillion a year globally (McKinsey). That's not going to be good value for money. That's nearly one-tenth of global GDP. That money would be better spent on a myriad of things including educating the fifth of humanity who are illiterate and represent a 7% annual loss to the world's economy. Any country that attempts it will be indebted or impoverished. Example: For the UK to reach net zero by electrification of its transport fleet and heating system, it will require a tripling (as a minimum) of its current electrical generation capacity among other things. This will essentially require the UK consuming all of the current global supply of copper and other rare metals for the next 25 years. The cost will be unaffordable and the skilled manpower levels unattainable"
"Yes, China is the largest producer of turbines and panels. The reason is you need the cheap energy from burning  coal to do that. In just 8 years (prior to 2021) China emitted more CO2 than Britain did since the start of Industrial Revolution that began over 220 years ago! And China plans to vastly increase its coal fired generating capacity. The UK is responsible for less than 1% of global CO2 emissions."
"There is always a drought or a fire somewhere, and always has been. These are weather events not climate."
"Our ""food systems"" are doing just fine. Between 1961 and 2021 global cereal production increased 250% and cereal yield increased over 200%. Land used for cereal hardly increased (Data from World Bank, FAO/UN). This is the only time in human history that you are more likely to be overfed rather than underfed. We should be thankful we were borne into an age of such abundance. A US DoE study (Taylor & Schlenker, 2021) estimated that a 1 ppm increase in CO2 led to an increase of 0.4%, 0.6% and 1% in yield for corn, soybeans and wheat, respectively, and that CO2 increase was the main driver of the 500% yield growth in corn since 1940. Global tomato production has set a record each year for the past 10 years. All 10 of the largest sugar crops in global history occurred during the past 10 years. All 10 of the 10 largest rice crop years occurred during the past 10 years (UNFAO). 2023 is another record cereal crop.
There is no global climate crisis. There is no evidence of one."

"None of this is happening.
Arctic sea ice coverage has stayed within its historical average ever since man began tracking its coverage.
The same goes for Antarctic sea ice coverage.
Greenlands ice sheet is still 10,000 feet thick at its thickest point.
Antarctica's eastern ice sheet is still 16,000 feet thick at its thickest point.
All of the rivers in North America are raging because of record snowfall and record snowpack levels up and down the west coast of North America.
Last years hurricane season in the tropical Atlantic was within the running average of 5.6.
USGS and NASA recently released a report about land subsidence on the eastern coast of the United States.
Every beach from Miami up to Maine is sinking.
This is due to post glacial isostatic rebound.
What this means is that the continental land surface that rebounded upward when the Laurentide ice sheet depressed the interior surface is now returning to its former position.
The coastline is also experiencing weathering from ocean waves, ocean tides, and rain.
Sand is very liquid in nature.
It can be easily moved around by water running over its surface.
This same natural weathering phenomenon is occurring on the coastline of Alaska, southeast asia, and Africa.
It's all natural."

"for people in here who care so much. Do something about it, this is pathetic."
"As regards the melting of Arctic Ice, the records nearly always seem to start in 1979. Strange that, considering it was a year of record extent for Arctic Ice. Even so, data from NOAA (2022) show winter (March) ice coverage has hardly changed since '79, and that the summer (September) coverage trend had stopped declining since 2007. How inconvenient! Didn't someone predict in 2007 Arctic ice free by 2010, or 2015, or 2013, or in 5 years? Or was it in 2008 the Arctic ice sheet would melt away. Also predicted in 2008 North Pole ice free in ... 2008 ... or in 10 years. 2009 prediction: Arctic ice free in 2014. 2012 prediction: snow will be gone by 2020. And 2013 star prediction: Methane catastrophe in 2 years because of ice free Arctic. 2018 prediction: zero chance of permanent ice in Arctic by 2022. It's still there, and it's stopped shrinking. 
If you consider global sea ice cover, it was basically flat from 1981 to 2008, rose until 2010, stayed level until 2015, dropped until 2018, and then rebounded almost all the way back to the 1990-2000 average. Nobody predicted theses changes, nor can they explain them. The changes have no relationship to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. 
The climate crisis/emergency/apocalypse is make-believe.
Multiyear ice is an unproductive habitat as far as marine organisms are concerned: first year (seasonal) ice over continental shelves is the most productive and this is where the vast majority of polar bears, seals, fish, whales, and sea birds are found. Therefore the decline of extremely thick multiyear ice (>4 years old) could be seen as an unconcerning development with regards to the wildlife in the region, especially since 2-3 year old ice that can be used as a resting/hunting platform for seals and polar bears hasn't declined in summer since 2007. In fact, biologically, the Arctic is in good shape with all its regions showing a positive trend in primary productivity over an extended period (2003-2022). This has resulted in more food for seals, walruses, bowhead whales and polar bears, which are  hence maintaining or expanding their populations. 
There's no ""death spiral"" in the region as some people reported. In fact, there is, as I say, no evidence of any crisis/emergency. That is silly nonsense designed to scare people."
More BBC propaganda.
More crap from the BBC. Time to defund.
"We cannot support this entire Earth with green energy, it's great but it only produces about 25% of what our needs are, without burning fossil fuels or nuclear energy we will all freeze!!! Just like Europe almost did last winter in 2022, I used to believe we could replace it to, not anymore. If we don't burn coal or have nuclear energy we will all freeze!!!!!! Stupid people!!!"

Should we clean up the water and air why yes China and India you should too! Instead they  fear monger more than ever!  
Now they’re hair brain ideas are windmills and solar panels  raping the  land of rare earth mineral yet have zero ability to store this power.  They say this will decrease energy prices ? They won’t do that either They sold us on plastics too” greatest invention ever “ now we have micro plastics in the water and food.
The rich pushing this so imagine.... they get richer.  Has anyone addressed where all this garbage wind mills, solar panels are going to go at the end of their life cycle ? No they have not!

China is the most responsible and guilty of the climate change crises. China is the most polluted country and the main source of pollution in the world. China is doing dangerous experiments of climate manipulation  to creat artificial rains which already resulted in disastrous flooding in many cities.
"Our planet Earth is a living organism, and Her blood is oil! Stop pumping blood from the bowels of Mother Earth and immediately. Otherwise, emigration to other planets and not the fact that people there for enrichment will not destroy Pirod, as well as on the planet Earth."

"More garbage and misinformation from the BBC. This is the reason hundreds of thousands of people are cancelling their TV license. FACT, both the northern and southern hemisphere have been cooling for most of the last decade and the southern hemisphere is cooling the fastest. The BBC is completely biased by only reporting stories that support the opposite. This is deliberately misleading and breaks all the rules on reporting standards. I have cancelled my license this year. You should do the same."

"Climate change... happened 10 times faster 12,000 years ago. Go educate yourselves. It was called The Younger Dryas Event."
I heard it is warming fifty times faster
Is less solar irradiation the reason for the warming? Somehow there are still people thinking less sun is warming the Earth.
I am so thankful for GOD's NATURAL changes on the Earth
I am so thankful for GOD's NATURAL changes on the Earth.

Oh look its affecting the white peoples way of life so now they are trying to everyone to do something about climate change
"it's impossible to spell the amount of laughter that this report brought me. News flash!!! it's called the sun and it goes through cycles. Every planet in our solar system is getting the same warming we are getting. The only way that they can scare the masses into energy slavery is to manipulate the data. Ask yourself if the Earths climate has ever been stable. You will find many warming cycles and those cooling cycles called ice ages.If it's really a climate crisis, perhaps the lizard people calling for change could park their private jets that spew out carbon at the rate of cities full of cars.))))"
When sending missionaries to convert people is prioritised than climate crisis. Welcome to western Christian nationalist countries
"During 2011-2018, the world spent US$3.6 trillion on climate change projects – 55% of which was spent on solar and wind projects.  Despite this wind and solar energy still produced only 3% of world energy consumption in the year 2018.  Not only are they expensive and ineffective, the review found that these projects sometimes contribute to problems they were designed to solve.  Both wind and solar farms are themselves causing local climate change. And, they have a devastating effect on biodiversity"
Lol
"Caused by overpopulation and China's industrial revolution, neither of which we can change!"
curant co2 is 450ppm it does not become harmfull till it is over 5000ppm get real and relax we need co2 to grow crops do you want to starve ?
"Ah, climate change. Boorrriiing"
"Geologic evidence and proxy data suggest that the earth has been significantly warmer and has had higher CO2 levels in the past, and all sorts of life thrived. This, of course, was before the global flood a few thousand years ago which radically changed the geography and climate of the planet. But there is also evidence to suggest parts of the earth were warmer after the flood than they are today. In fact, historical records indicate there were several warm periods including the medieval warm period (MWP) between AD 300 and 1900 in which people were able to farm in Greenland—an area currently covered in ice.
Warmer temperatures can extend growing seasons, which allows for increased agricultural production. Cooler temperatures can cripple agricultural production as evidenced by the “little ice age” that occurred in 1400 shortly after the MWP. During the “little ice age,” the Thames River in London froze over and much of Britain experienced food shortages."
Hence do something.
"Lol...climate change. 
Maybe the BBC should pay more attention to everyone else around the globe who have already proved by using SCIENCE,  that this climate change emergency as they are selling it, doesn't actually exist.  

Thank you to all INDEPENDENT MEDIA, ALL SCIENTISTS who are speaking out about the climate change agenda.  

The WEF agenda should we all call it !! 

And the BBC who are currently facing law suits for the spead of MISINFORMATION and CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS still sit here night after night pushing out fake news reports. 

Laughable.. !"

Only thing that's heating  up is the joy  at  globalist  tax on poor by the globalist  cabal or gang
"The trusted BBC just keep peddling this rubbish. CO2 accounts for about 1-2% of climate change, so that is effectively 0 degC. The main causes are the Milankovic Cycles, not that the BBC-trusting viewers even know what they are, as the BBC have yet to tell them this 100 year news. But the second is sunspots and the BBC don't want to cover this either, I wonder why? Could it be that it has nothing to do with man and we cannot do anything about it anyway...which means their paymasters won't make any money out of it. Well that's what you get from the trusted BBC...lies morning, noon and night."
"remember when the left dubbed everything weather related as ""GLOBAL WARMING"".  Then after everyone started calling them out on their bs, they quitely renamed it as ""CLIMATE CHANGE"".   oh yeah... umm climate change has been happening for the last 270 thousand years."
"It is so sad. Sad for my kids, and kids all over this planet."
"Climate change has become a religion for so many irrational and easily manipulated people. Even if one believes that a microscopic amount of CO2 is controlling the climate (CO2 makes up .0004% of the atmosphere) there is absolutely nothing we can do about it. A few people with means can buy an electric car so they can pretend they are doing their part for climate change. Although the mining for the minerals needed to produce the batteries for electric vehicles cause some of the most severe environmental damage on the planet along with producing gigantic amounts of CO2 by the heavy vehicles used to extract those minerals. 

The religious zealots like to pretend that solar panels and windmills are the cure. But those only produce electricity and electricity is only 20% of the energy used by the world. And both of these ""green/renewable"" sources aren't even close to being either green or renewable as again the fossil fuels needed to mine the minerals necessary to produce solar and wind make them anything but clean, plus they only have a life span of 15-25 years and then you have to replace them. And then there is the inconvenient fact that both of these energy sources have to be fully backed up for those times when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. So for every solar or wind farm you also need a coal fired power plant to back them up. Paying twice for energy. Now there's an efficient plan.

It doesn't matter how hard one tries to pretend, the world in its current form runs on fossil fuels, and even more specifically it runs on diesel. The ships, trains, trucks, construction vehicles, planes, etc. etc. all run on diesel and jet fuel. No amount of self delusion is going to change that. So unless you are prepared to return to life as it was in the 18th century when the average life span was about 35 years, then all of this nonsense is nothing more than a ridiculous form of virtue signaling. 

How many of you climate change true believers are prepared to walk or ride a bike to work everyday? How many of you are prepared to eat cold meals everyday? Take cold showers? Grow your own food, as without diesel and natural gas based fertilizer there won't be any food on the shelves in your local grocery store. Freeze in the winter and sweat in the summer? No vacations for you as planes will have to become a thing of the past as will diesel powered ships. So no trips to Hawaii unless you can endure a multi week ride in a sail boat. Virtually every aspect of modern life has a fossil fuel component to it. How many of you are prepared to radically reduce your standard of living?

So ask yourself, are you personally ready to make this kind of gigantic sacrifice in your quality of life to try and reduce the CO2 level from .0004% to .0003%? And if you aren't willing to do what's necessary, then why would you think anyone else is? And if you are capable of rationalizing that none of these climate change goals are even remotely feasible you might start to wonder why we keep pushing this drivel like you are watching in this ridiculous video? Why do the politicians espousing this nonsense fly all over the world in private planes spews tons of CO2, buy estates on the coast, spends 10's of thousands of dollars heating and cooling their mansions etc.? And if the religion isn't so deeply entrenched that you can contemplate the answer to these questions you might make the leap to the truth that this is all about money. We've spent 10 trillion dollars to lower the CO2 output in the US from 20% of global to 14%. It hasn't reduced total global CO2 by one bit though as the rest of the world continues to increase it's fossil fuel usage year after year as third world countries continue to emerge from abject poverty. So realistically we've spent 10 trillion dollars and accomplished .... nothing. Is it time to wake up or shall we waste another 10 trillion with the same result?"
"Hey everyone... don't believe Man. This climate change is all a lie !!! God says in Genesis 8:22 ""While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."" ... are you going to believe God , Our Creator or Ungodly Men that are rich with money but not in faith!!! No matter what these people say about climate change, they are using it to try  and control us. Every summer is Hot and every winter is cold... there's nothing wrong with the climate. God is in total control and those people from the World economic forum are only believers in their Money but not In the True creator.. they are trying to be in control of what God is in control of. Please share this"
"Damn He said it ""if we cant give up fossil fuel in the the fastest warming place on Earth What hope for the Rest"""

"What I don't understand is how back in the Days of the Vikings Greenland was in fact green.  There were large settlements there, but was the world was much colder back then?

Similarly, in the days of smog filled London, the river Thames froze in winter.  Are all these climate change experts absolutely certain that this general warming is not due just to the opacity of the atmosphere, and more of the sun's radiation hitting the Earth, rather than some oversensitivity to a gas that makes up less than 1% of the atmosphere that is very soluble in water vapor, another greenhouse gas that exists in many times greater quantity in the atmosphere.

It just sounds really unlikely to be true.  And all these videos just seem to focus hard on the consequences of global warming, rather than the mechanics, exactly what you would do if you didn't want people to focus too hard on the science.

These green policies could kill millions of people more than global warming will, I really think we can't just say, ""Whoops, made a mistake, never mind!"", if it turns out to be wrong.

Or alternatively, if we all commit to the green agenda for 5 years, and if it doesn't result in any change in global temperatures, we imprison every climate scientist and activist for the rest of their lives, for fraud?"
The climate has changed for the whole history of the planet saying you want to stop climate change is idiotic can you also stop the rapid expansion of the universe while your at it I think it’s moving to fast.

The two weeks of climate discussions at the COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, ended in disappointment. As CNN wrote, “The world has failed to reach an agreement to phase out fossil fuels … an attempt to address the biggest source of the planet warming emissions that are causing the climate crisis ended in a fiasco after a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels, not just coal.” While the members reached an agreement “to set up a ‘loss and damage’ fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters,” it will not reverse climate change or solve our major problems.
We may be able to assist with local climate crises, but we cannot change the global climate with our current attitude. If we want to change the climate, we must change it on all levels, and first and foremost the social climate we have created. As long as it is negative, aggressive, and heating up, the global climate will reflect it.
The reason we hold global climate conferences is that the climate is a global issue. Everything we do, in any country, affects the global climate. Therefore, without global mutual consideration, humanity will not be able to resolve the climate crisis.
Regrettably, to work in global mutual consideration, we must develop empathy toward all of humanity and rise above the narrow interests of each country. We are nowhere near such an attitude. On the contrary, each country tries to impose decisions that serve its own interests on the rest of the world, and the result is a climate world war where everyone loses.
As is the case with every war, the rich and powerful countries set the tone. They continue to burn fuels that pollute the air and accelerate climate change, and nothing will stop them unless natural disasters become so extreme that they will force all of humanity to change. In the meantime, as lip service, or perhaps to buy the world’s consent, they set up “loss and damage” funds to “repair” the damage. Such funds do not solve anything, and everyone realizes this.
Besides extreme weather and climate disasters, the climate crisis has another adverse impact: Icebergs that have been frozen for thousands of years, and often far longer, are thawing. And buried in the ice are countless viruses that have been reawakened, and for which our bodies have no immunity. Scientists are already warning that the next pandemic may actually come not from wild animals or human errors, but from melting icebergs. A paper published two years ago aptly named it the “permafrost pandemic,” and warned of “the risk that deadly diseases from the distant past may return.”
Indeed, if you look at all the crises plaguing the world today, you will find that none of them are local. Covid is a global issue, climate change is affecting the entire planet, rising energy prices and interrupted supply chains are affecting all of humanity, and even a local crisis such as the war in Ukraine has serious consequences for the entire world. The interdependence already affecting all of humanity will only intensify until we are unable to make a single movement, to take a breath, without affecting the entire world.
On the positive side, none of our problems are insurmountable. In every single crisis, if we only work together rather than against each other, it will disappear as though it never existed.
All that is needed in order to fix our every plight is to change our attitude and put humanity first. Since reality is global, so should be our order of priorities. Prioritizing humanity will not only help the entire world, but every single individual, precisely because we are irrevocably interdependent. If we continue to impose a narrow vision on an expansive reality, we will continue to collide with one another and with all of nature. If we change our attitude, we will change the climate, and we will change the world."

"There has been no records broken, the UN's own world metrological group has said there has been no significant change to historical norms with regards to temperature, number and intensity of storms, hurricanes or fires, the fact of the matter is we are not killing the planet doing what we are doing, we just need to help developing countries like India do it smarter, go nuclear power not coal fired, same for the rest of us."
The rich are panicking because normal everyday people will be living nearer the sea with nice warm weather. A privilege the rich pay for at great cost. If mansions near the sea cost 20 quid instead of 20million then we might believe it. As for Greece ask any locals rich land developers have purposely set fires for years too clear  protected landscapes so they can profit. Take note of these lands on fire and in a few years there will be hotels and holiday villas.

"""One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with the environmental policy . . . . We redistribute de facto the world's wealth by climate policy

There is a film with a different angle on climate change. It departs from the orthodox narrative and points the true driving force behind it. Here is a link to the trailer: https://youtu.be/8OW4qVUzIv4?si=dB5ff_WJ66m4jS4q
"People Power has the potential to:
Make cheap clean power anywhere,
Reduce most unemployment anywhere,
Eliminate poverty through stored energy sales  anywhere. 

First what is people power?

Power out from a storm or disaster?
There's People Power, any low tech solution that would bring power to any stricken area where people are. Wind and water turn wheels to make power, but so can people. Yes it can be stored ahead of time. Yes it's portable.  Yes it's inexpensive. Yes it's good for the environment. Yes it's safe.
People Power, free power in any emergency, anywhere there are people. 

Next...
People Power not only could make energy in an emergency power outage,  but that type of low tech could also store energy for future use.  That stored energy could be kept for backup, used in that area, or transfered and sold somewhere else. 

We also know that there are places in the world where many people need work.  Why not combine the two. Out of work people could be hired to use their physical power to make energy. They would not need much training, and virtually any healthy adult could do it full time or part time.
Next the extra money generated, could be used to buy solar panels to augment their revenues. 

What we must insure is that these workers are paid a fair, honest wage, and treated well. This can never be forced labor. 

Sum up: This is clearly a win win for everyone: Healthy power, many new unskilled jobs, and the end of poverty anywhere in the world,  all in a new power industry."
"Ha ha, more lefty climate alarmist crap from the BBC. No wonder so many normal (ie not left wing) people have defunded the idiots.

"The transition to sustainable energy sources is paramount, necessitating a decisive shift away from fossil fuels to mitigate the adverse effects of global warming."
"Have you followed what is happening in the world now with the climate, for example, in one day 19 volcanoes woke up. there are a lot of earthquakes happening. this is not normal. and you listened to “Emergency appeal by scientist Egon Cholakyan to humanity: the planet is on the verge of self-destruction” - this is the first appeal, and there are three of them. so the authorities are shamefully silent and after his appeal they must shout about it everywhere"
"Rubbish. Scientist have known since the early 1900s that the warming effect of each molecule of CO2 declines as the concentration increases. 

Ethical scientist not on green gravy train tell us the CO2 greenhouse effect has been deliberately and grossly exaggerated for money, power and control. The global climate is one of the most complex, chaotic, non-linear natural systems known, which is in a constant state of flux due to many factors – CO2 plays a minor role. Making a deliberate single parameter correlation is scientific fraud. 

Meanwhile there has only been approximately 1 – 1.5 C warming since the middle of the Little Ice Age – a change so modest and gradual know one in the general public would have noticed were it not for 24/7 fear-mongering propaganda. Pointing to weather events and cherry picked data going back only 150 years that ignores the Medieval and Roman warming periods is propaganda. Climate cycles are measured in 30 year cycles. A few hot, rainy or dry years in a row means nothing

CO2 is not a pollutant for the first time in history killing the planet. CO2 is 'Safe and Effective'. There is no climate emergency.

"leading scientists have told? 
misinformation, cherry picking, ignoring natural climate change, heatwaves in the 1930’s were extreme, urban heat island is another anomally, average temps totally messed up with up to 40% of stations not ideal, airports , cities etc.  and the bbc , the station sacks anyone daring to question anything."
I call BS. Let's keep pulling oil out the sea to lower water lvls 👍 if this was real why are mortgages still given to properties on the coast? Seems only countries without oil push this. If you have no oil wealth you need to ban it to keep in global power. Why aren't we planting trees to counter? Or is that to cheap and a permanent solution that can't scam the tax payer
Poland. We haven't seen great snow in 12–20 years. We used to have enormous amounts of snow and even snowstorms. Now we don't have any of that.
"As a hard pressed taxpayer 
i am.sick of.paying for

"You mean the scientists really are right!! Global warming IS happening, well.... but the newspapers said they were lying! 
""Livable as possible"" 😅 God help us."
"Canada 🇨🇦 is one of the coldest 🥶🥶🥶 countries in the world!!!  Also, we contribute to Climate Change in a very small way.  The world needs our oil and gas!!!!!"
"Well in Canada 
They used to use water bombers to put out fires in the past ..Now they seem to let them burn .
Notice they never blame rockets going into space or wars around the world ..hmmm"
bullshit
Human extinction from climate change is the inevitable outcome. We breached 1.5 c this year and will pass it on a few years. At current rate earth will warm 6 degrees centigrade by 2100 easily cussin enough methane to be released for extinction of humans and 90 percent of other animals. Stop relying on fake hope. This may well be the last century of human life on earth and guy McPherson says even sooner
I think we need to change small things first so that environmental problems don't get worse.
Everyone should be aware of the global warming problem and try to solve it
I regret that the flood caused casualties.
I hope global warming is resolved 😭
We know the world is warming by humans emitting green house gas ! This is a blatant lie .
Years ago I saw a fictional doc drama on BBC called heatwave oh the prog was shown in 2005 they forecast this
Climate change - the ultimate tin foil hat conspiracy
yeah we finna die
"The weather has only been recorded since 1850, It was 14° hotter 500 million yrs ago . So this is all a scam."
"The single most troubling indicator of global heating is the 1.2 TRILLION TONS of global melting ice, as it is our global AC and is sucking-up 2.16 X 10 to the 17th BTU'S PER DAY.      How long can this go on?     77-110 yrs.     Venus 2.0?     The net is full of research supporting these numbers, if you just Google a bit of climate research."
"No they are lying. They changed the way they mesure trmp. Sgandard temp is recorded 2 meters above ground. They are measuring temp at ground level which is hotter...Lies, lies, lies..."
"LOL U MAD UK, HA HA, SOON Y OU'LL BE ON FIRE :) THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT"
Hopefully next year we can beat the record!  If we all work together we can achieve anything!  🏆
"Time is up, they don't tell you,  but we have passed the point of NO RETURN,  I am very sorry for Humanity, especially the kids 😓😱😭"
"With the level of greenhouse gases steadily increasing and average global temperatures keeping pace, if you’re not feeling angst because of this, then you’ve either not been paying attention or else you’ve convinced yourself that the globe is warming because of some other cause — which is even scarier, because that means there’s nothing we can do to save ourselves.
Note: If there were no human influences on climate, Earth's current orbital positions within the Milankovitch cycles indicate that our planet should be cooling, not warming, continuing a long-term cooling trend that began 6,000 years ago
Search: ‘Milankovitch cycles predict’
Search: ‘graph for 10,000 years global temperatures shows we're screwed’"
All part of the conditioning ....well it won't work with me.if it summer in the UK..its probably raining..nothing new there...
"Record temperatures mean don’t mean  hottest ever just since  we’ve been keeping records.
The planet has seen periods of NO  ice caps . We are coming out of a mini ice age from the 1700’s.

"Don't worry people of Earth, a volcano will happen soon, it will cool the Earth by 3 degrees, everything will be made like new again. So be of good cheer."
Climate change is the story of how humanity destroyed itself..we are in the end times for real. We screwed up the garden.
"I live in Brazil, in the city of Mossoró. Here it is so hot!  I don't know how or why our politicians have no been paying attention in our climatic changes, the temperature grow up since the beggin of this year, the news have been announced often about the consequences of the capitalism and the pollution in nature and how it can influence in our society, our children have been studying about this in Science and our teenagers have been studying about this in Biology, futhermore we have the college students. Please someone could explain to me what are not happen here, in our city? Our mayor agreed with the destruction of one natural lake next to UFERSA - a public univesity, that could be a place for protect the nature against the human changes and think about our next generations - and our main lake - Rio Mossoró - is so durty, its color is green, animals can not live there. But no, for them is more important have space for constroy structures for parties like Feira do Bode.  What happen? Or better, what are not happen here? But I have one thing to say. If we not protect the nature we will not have a future, and the parties will not be the answer for our climate changes, and it will influence in all things, since the agriculture for our life style! We will not have a future."
"In the last 11 years, I have been through a 1-in-100-year flood, a 1-in-200-year flood, and a super-cell storm so powerful the golf ball-sized hail stones turned my house into Swiss cheese. I'm already feeling the hopelessness of it all and every time it rains I'm crippled by fear. It IS getting worse.

I personally blame the people still denying it even those in this comment thread. I hope you live long enough to see your house under 12 feet of water, reduced to ashes from bush fires, or roofless, shattered husks like some kind of scene out of Scarface."
"If global warming is so bad, they should get rid of the central heating at all BBC buildings. Reality would kick-in within minutes for all the BBC staff who would bleat about being cold.😂😂😂😂"

"Just watched a BBC report saying it will take decades to breach the 1.5 degree threshold... please stop lying to the public, it will be breached in only a few years. Are you people lying or just ignorant?"
"Mmm. Several issues:

Temperature forcast this summer were not realised. Not reported.

The Maldives are not under water.

Ex Presidents are buying multi million $$$ properties next to the ocean.

We need a home working push...peopke can't afford new elec cars ...let's cut pollution now asxwe need to by home working.  We won't be goingvto work anyway if we lise control of weather and our car tyres melt into roads
"I wish that even one of these climate reports included the amount of carbon taxes being collected by world governments and how they are mitigating the climate crisis.  In CA they pay over $5 BILLION annually, just from the carbon tax on a gallon of gas. A lot of money from just one tax in one state.  And it does absolutely nothing to affect climate."

"There is a problem with electric cars: They are 30% heavier than petrol models. Use more of earths minerals. On a long journey on the motorway service station I saw motorists were arguing that they needed to urgently charge their car to get to work. Batteries have a 5-7 year life. Batteries are charged from roadside chargers powered by coal/nuclear power stations. Because the cars are heavier the tyres are bigger with more effect on the road, lastly miles on a full charge depends on the weight its carrying so that 5 people could reduce the mileage by 25%."

God does, but we're blasphemous in such large numbers God may just stand back and watch us fry. Don't believe me? Read revelation start to finish. I was watching global temps just because it's on the news. Uh it's climbing super fast and the oceans are heating up which causes earths heat to spiral out of control because the oceans usually cool off the earth. Reconnect with your loved ones, take that trip or do that thing You've always wanted to do, we've only about 10 years left to live if that."
STOP TELLING BS.
What a Joke HEADS on FIRE AZZ CATCHING 🤬😂
"Climate Change as marketed by the United Nation's IPCC has a legal disclaimer at the back of the nearly 200 page IPCC science report where it states they only took their greenhouse gas samples at 20,000 meters altitude which is far into the stratosphere.  It is high school taught science that no greenhouse radiant energy exists after 20 meters from the earth's surface.  This  statement is a legal back stop to protect the authors from fraud prosecution.   This is analogous to a beverage advertised as ""All Natural Fruit Flavors"" then reading the ingredients it states ""contains no actual fruit juices"".   Global warming has been basically stalled at 1°C since 1991 when global warming was reported at 1.1°C.  In 2022 global warming was reported at 1.06°C typically rounded to 1.1°C.  There is noway around these statements."
Its too heartbreaking 🥹 no one know how to weather will react
Democratic elections have a very large carbon footprint compared to a dictatorship or a military coup.
"Pay attention. There is still time to ""keep the planet as livable as possible"". It's too late to prevent massive loss of life. We are fighting for *survivability* (which is doubtful at this point)."
Dr. Patrick Moore is a well respected scientist who does a great job debunking the climate change alarmists. The dumbest people on the planet fall for the global warming fraud.
Really? You know what the temperature was a thousand years ago or even 500 years ago? Doom and gloom is all the liberals can cry about worshipping their climate change religion!
We're all doomed doomed i tells ya.😅
They shouldn't be recording with a background that makes you think that the heat is fun because kids are playing in water in Greece. It would be visually better if they recorded near actual wildfires or somewhere where it could really  show how bad things are turning out

"Dear YouTube, many people have been sexually abused by BBC employees including many children. Please de monetise and cancel this channel from your platform."
"Another great video, but it's completely pointless as those who should see it won't see it. Serious question: why are we still waiting for governments to do something about it, when we've all agreed that no government in the world can be trusted, let alone depended on? So what are we actually talking about here? Pointing the finger at the government and blaming them for everything is super easy. Too simple. And that's where the problem lies. We should gradually start to take our destiny into our own hands and not wait for a government to solve our social problems, it has been decades too late for that anyway. Sorry, but the last 3 years have shown me that hope and good will always invariably lead to hate and discord in the end. Maybe we should just speed up global warming instead of trying desperately to slow it down. My generation no longer has any hopes in anything, neither in the future nor in society. The reason for our existence was taken from us and there is no going back. Its too late. And the sooner we accept that, the easier it will be for us in the future."

Yeah tell it the rich who wouldn’t want to travel in anything that is not a Rolls Royce or a Bentley or wouldn’t prefer to fly in a commercial plane like the rest of us.
"Preserve the bog lands and moors. They absorb CO2. Ie, look after our farmers!!!"
Reduce carbon emissions? Stop charging workers benefit in kind tax for living in accommodation provided on campus! We're just trying to be green!
"since CO2 is a non-lethal, colorless, odorless gas that is necessary for a flourishing planet and is NOT a significant greenhouse gas, this is just another hysterical piece of garbage science without verification"
"Remember folks, the carbon they want to reduce is us."
Raw Global temperature data shows the Earth has been cooling since 1930. Only when the data has been manipulated does it show warming. Just ask NOAA for the raw data. Cheers.

"WHEN PRIVATE JETS ARE BANNED I COULD TAKE THIS CRAP SERIOUSLY, CO2 IS NEEDED FOR PLANTS TO LIVE, HOW MUCH PLANT LIFE WILL WE LOSE WITH THIS BRAINDEAD ATTITUDE, NASA SAYS THE WORLD IS GREENER,SO THE PLANTS ARE TAKING UP THE CO2/"
CO-2 Is needed for plants to GROW.  Then Plants give us oxygen.  They even have carbon generators to put into GROW HOUSES.  Co-2 is good and needed for PLANTS.  Think what they want.

My carbon footprint had become terrible and all of my socks are noticeable to become loose, tiredsome and greasy even after wash.

"Dear ClimaTards:
1. CO2 is currently 420 ppm, which is 0.042%.

Humans are responsible for 3% of that, which is 0.00126%.

Thus, 99.99874% of all CO2 is created naturally.

2. At under 270 ppm CO2, plant life dies, and everything else dies with it.

3. The atmosphere has had periods where CO2 was up to and higher than 4000 ppm. During the Triassic period 215 million years ago, both plant and animal life thrived and Alaska was a jungle.

4. When Mt. St Helens erupted in 1980, it released the same amount of pollution as 270 years of human industrial activity in 1970.

That’s 270 x 1970 industrial activity -
IN ONE DAY. Tonga eruption was nearly double.
At least get educated before  complain with no solution. This is about Control and Wealth Transfer. And all cultists are useful idiots. Twas always thus and always thus will be. If you really want to have an impact, simply remove yourself from the planet?"

So many (not all) of the large corporations are the ones who caused this problem in the first place but we as individuals are responsible to clean up their mess and revolutionize the way we live and they continue to do what they do? Shouldn't this be addressed at the top level first?

"Individual versus corporate versus governments.
Put emphasis where it counts. How much rubbish does a single person generate.? How much does a corporation generate.? Taxation and double-taxation. Profit-revenue of corporation shared with individuals.? Who bear the profits.? Who pay the taxes.?"
Co2 we give off the trees take it in. They give us o2 in return.
I don't even try to calculate how much Co2 I add to our atmosphere. The earth is in a CO2 drought. I do everything I can to increase CO2 output as everyone should. Do your part to make our planet greener and more comfortable. Consider driving somewhere just for the heck of it. It's really that easy.

Will all these restrictions coming with the limit be allowed going out of your house to work or buying food only for 2-3 days in a week and then wearing face mask, to reduce carbon?  How much airplane travel I can have within one year? 

I bet you must install ventilation system with filters in your house, does the government paying this or the individual with his monthly salary? 
Does anyone here have mor einformation about this topic ?"
Start with the carbon from big corporations .......goverments.... military.... and billionaires. They are some of the biggest polluters!

"I learned in grade 8 that nature has a way of balancing carbon and oxygen within our atmosphere.  That is to say, a balance between the HUMAN SPECIES carbon ""foot print"" and the oxygen ""foot print"" of PLANTS and TREES. Perhaps we need to think twice before we cut down trees instead of worrying about our carbon foot print? 

Furthermore, I also learned in grade 7 that the human body is 18% carbon!!! Then I began to think about it and began to wonder if the goal of the WEF, to eliminate humanity and replace them with AI? Perhaps Bill Gates knows more about this!!

"So, some rich people run huge factories to produce luxury products, then media make ordinary people think that they can't live without these products. People then get loans to buy whatever they have been persuaded to buy in order to belong and fit in the modern society, the factories owners, the banks, and the media get richer, and yet the person in debt the same that is making them richer have to pay for the carbon footprint resulting from their business"

If you are concerned about warming, you should know that at 70%, the main greenhouse gas is water vapor.

Like see bbc foot print hypocrites
It is not my footprint. I'm paying for the food and I expect this food to be produced with 0 emissions of CO2. But it is not because the producer is willing to produce more for a profit and leaving a trace in the nature. The companies responsible for the transportation of the products generate profits. Same for the stores. I do not generate profit while consuming. I'm paying for it. Why you blame me for the carbon footprint? During my life I planted many trees and can ensure you I'm neutral. I have no car and rarely using transport but the oil company continue drilling the planet. When they gonna pay for the damage? The problem is in the ones generating profit - ask them to pay for their actions

"as a person from africa i do not care about climate change.yes it is real but europeans were the first to industrialize. i say i am okay with the end because as an african i never enjoyed this world.this world was always based on color and other dumb stuff.  on an earth that i was born in i cant even be allowed by whites to just exist without discrimination. europeans always behaved liked they belonged more on earth than everyone else. they started the whole palestine israel chaos.

i am trying to feed my family at great sacrifice. well some white guy will say wasnt it for whites you' d still be living in the bush.maybe the bush was the way humans and nature could be at one."

I couldent care less. The Bible says that the world Will burn up. Why is almost everyone so worried?
"luckily for you lot, Bill Hates has promised to SRM that AGW into submission with more of his fully tested, safe & effective ‘$CIENCE!™️’. Believe !"
You forgot to include the impact of intense animal farming...that is the biggest problem.

"Climate change is not real, it’s political, just an excuse to tax us for the air we breath. The Michael Mann 1998 hockey stick data underpinning the whole propaganda program has never been released for peer review (after 24 years and one very expensive court case won by Dr Tim Ball) and now the whole project (headed by organisations working for the UN) is costing tax payers trillions of dollars without there ever being any chance of a diligent examination of the outcome of such spending. The climate change hoax needs to be condemned whenever and wherever it raises its ugly blood-sucking, barmy, uncorroborated voice. 

The carbon tax ball-and-chain idea and the 2 year pandemic economic slump combined with the other poor decisions made by western leaders will only hasten the west’s demise and welcome in the rising Asian hegemony which will thankfully once again usher in a new age of reason, true science and game-changing technology to the advantage of humanity. 

Note that Chinese manufacturers continued trading uninterrupted throughout the pandemic. All online orders were completed without delays. The quality of the Chinese goods equaled or exceeded the quality those of the west. Chinese coal, gas and nuclear power stations continued to grow over the years of the pandemic to meet the needs of their manufacturing sector, while the west power stations showed little or no expansion, with their 10 year plans stagnant or shattered, their refineries closing down and their markets serving only to distribute mainly Asian goods. That is the measure of the economic status of the major western powers and that is all down to crazy greed and infighting in western political arenas. One cannot help draw parallels between the Western demise and the Roman demise as both were self inflicted."
"I converted a council house as part of CLG's retrofit for the future in 2015. I installed air source heat pumps and solar thermal. There was some massive problems:
1. The heat pumps were noisy and bulky.
2. You need to fit a hot water boiler, where if your house is small?
3. The heat when you want it is not responsive as gas heating so you need to plan when you want to be warm.
4. Heat pumps , ground or air, only work effectively if the property is totally insulated and virtually air tight. I had to fit 100mm thermal insulation to all internal walls.
5. Double glazing wasn't effective. I needed triple K glass
6. The control device is complicated and needs summer/winter timing programs
7. I also fitted solar panels, but the roof was not new/strong enough to support the panels and needed to be replaced.
8. I wanted ground source heat pumps but you need to bury several large coils 10ft into the ground/garden.
9. Take up the floor and isolate every joist from the brickwork
Total cost £143k 
After 12 months with a tenant the heat pump had to be removed as they couldn't work it properly. All in all its sounds a good idea for middle/high income earners but your average tenant in a 1940's semi will never be able to have it."
"English weather, grey, cold, depressing and alway rainy - say that we should protect it. Of course I would have to have +4 degrees. Maybe Barcelona wants to protect their nice weather, but definitely not me. I'm tired of this. Because of covid we all stuck in out weather zones. Because of brexit we can't live aboard and because of government will introduce jet fuel tax and tourist taxes introduction in warm counties, travel will become less affordable. What sucks for all of us in UK. I want that sun here, then we could protect it."
I don't care... IT'S NOT EVEN A THING
"If your average person doesn’t understand the greenhouse effect, then you can bet that all too many politicians don’t either. Why? Because it’s about how visible light is converted to infrared light and then reradiated away from the planet’s surface as heat and interacts with the larger atmospheric gases like water vapor, CO2, methane, etcetera — thus, slowing down the cooling of the Earth. It’s easier to ignore that which you don’t understand, yet.

"BBCs reporting on the issue of climate change is borderline criminal. I don't think it's malicious, I think it's lack of scientific/technical knowledge on the part of the reporters. Still embarrassing. When you read the studies quoted there are always key items they have misinterpreted."
"the worst part about climate change solutions is that we can only delay the inevitable, not fix it. unless we were to make the most drastic changes to our way of life that will both destroy our economy, our privileged comforts, and our population. I'd rather see the world get swallowed by the ocean and change our way of life now, so that life on earth could be better in the future. if that means killing off the human race, so, we won't care when we're dead."

"Sadly, BBC in this case has become part of the promotional campaign for AI.  The general public is skeptical and rightly so, technology has already invaded our lives to an absurd level and now the greedy tech companies can't wait to take over everything.  We don't need any more AI, we need less.  What we need are governments and businesses who are not greedy, who care about people and the environment."
"Why are people salty on this comment section? 
You are used to documentaries of how African countries are suffering in poverty that you don't believe news on an African country that is prospering? 
Kenya is richer than most East European countries for your information, if it was a member of the EU it would not be the poorest."
I once visited Kericho and was amazed with horticulture and tea growing
Its interesting technology but its not at all the communist fake climate change. 😂🎉😂🎉
"The BBC reporting for ' Farming Today'. WHY?   Putting up acres of plastic has proved to reflect sunlight and allow clouds NOT to form. This reduces rainfall and increases water being drawn from the aquifer, leading to even dryer conditions. These are flowers and while it provides important employment, its not food. If even larger area's are covered in Plastic the local Micro climate will change. Also where is their market please?  Its hardly AI, Just a computer programme aiding early Aphid infestation to be detected. More plastic will add to climate change."
One would have thought the growing of food would have priority over roses in Africa.

They must be trained in special solutions.
so artificial intelligence should control our food and flower agricultures instead of humans?

I thank you and hope that you can help me thanks to humanity.

Jesus Christ is returning soon, an if you want to be rapture ready, its pretty simple. one belive that Jesus died on the cross and spilled his own blood for are sins, was buried and rose on the third day from the dead in glory. 2. admit your a sinner and your need him to save you. 3. repent your sins on him and in faith and trust and belive in him to save you. Because as scruputure say. there be people left behind to face gods wraith and fae the mark of the beast. were a person will have it on there right hand or forehead. so if you stay behind dont take the mark satay in faith to jesus for this time will be hell on earth. lucifer will force you to takei do not accept it choose death. i pray you and many get saved and my fellow christians spread the word.

"🌹flowers have incredible power. 
Their fragile beauty and brief life can teach us to enjoy without attachment, to experience deeply while knowing full well the experience is temporary. 
It is the same with all life...

Life will have its joys and its sorrows; to live fully we must live from the source, without attachment to either pleasure or pain…"

"It is a scientific fact that CO2 emissions are heavier than air. The lightest of all bird feathers are heavier than air. They might be blown all over the earth, but they do not rise into the stratosphere! The methane emitted by cows and humans are short lived and are filtered out through the air. 
The sun emits many gasses including carbon. So what was the cause of global warming that spelled the end of the so called Ice-Age; where a lot of the ice covering the earth, melted away leaving the north and south Ice caps? That is, apart from the top of high mountains?"

Would it make more sense to produce rose oil?  It was $200 oz for awhile…  or maybe freeze dry roses for arrangements and ship direct to consumers.

"I lived in Italy, and there, (at least the town I lived in) there were two stores of second hand everything immaginable. For instance, you don't need a chair - you take it there, someone WILL buy it, you get a percentage. Than when I came back in my homecountry, big city, I saw (even though english is not our language, but many people speak it well) a stora called Second hand, got in expecting to see lots of stuff like above. However, I realised that here, the trend hasn't yet arrived. Only clothes were sold. In a couple years, the idea might spread here too."
Recycling can help.
Listening from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
The problem is publicity in France for exemple a publicity to sell furniture to put book on shelf in a bulding near the stair in stead of buy less.... Or a girl who want to change hers bedroom.... by sale her furniture and to buy new furniture... instead of make a real choice in the first place... all that it's in fact false solution to sale furniture... a joke the solution it's to ask one'self do I realy need that....
Recycling is a scam advertised by corporations to make people think that they can keep consuming without destroying the planet.

"Have a look at epigenetics, dear researchers."
"This is about adaptation, not evolution in the Darwinian sense, nor in the Neo-Darwinian sense.  And that adaptation happens all the time in a time frame of a few years.  The main today known system behind it is epigenetics, a rapid, reversible, fluctuating adaptation."

"These CC weirdos crack me up. LMAO! ""They're altogether OOKY, the CC family!"""
"The BBC should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such nonsense and propaganda . There is no climate alarm climate change is a given. and in fact we should count ourselves lucky that we are living in a warm period of the earth's climate cycle because the normal is ice cold . The earth is still in an ice age however interrupted by short warm periods and only 200 years ago when we were having a mini ice age in the northern hemisphere winters were so cold that the river Thames used to freeze over and you could walk across it. Fact There has been no increase in average temperatures for the last 18 years , but they wont tell you that . In fact the sun is about to enter a ''maunder minimum '' so winters are going to get colder and summers will be cooler and wet"

"Will humanity evolve too? After all, we are not special"
"The rate of  change now by global warming is extreme for any species or most...animals and plants. No, they can't adapt as evolution works in thousand of years and more depending on species. Read Science."
"No, animals can't evolve in 30 years. They're going to die. We're already losing 100 plant and animal species every single day on average. 100 species. Every. Single. Day."
It's a physop.  Just ask yourself who benefits big corporations. Wake up sheep.
Adaptation takes time. There is no time. It's not difficult. Extinction is now the only game in town.
"Yes, the climate has been changing during all of deep time. However, the rate of change matters a lot. And, the current rate is 100 to 1000 times the normal or even abnormal rate of change.  So, I think vertebrates are screwed if close to the worst case is what we cause to happen. OTOH, insects breed so fast and can often fly, so they will do better."
Well the climate has been changing for hundreds of thousands of years and creatures have adapted so far.
"Good news. Since 1890, deaths from weather and climate related events have reduced by 95%.
Wildfires have reduced by 90% since 1900.  Since 1980, the planet has warmed by 0.02c. 
co2 levels are low compared to a few thousand years ago. It levels drop to 150ppm, all life on earth will cease.

"The most important thing is not where the energy comes from, it is how, and in what proportion, we use it. Firstly we have to reduce our standard of living, we don't need all these products and services to live happily and healthily."
"The renewable energy itself is not enough, unfortunately I would add, some nuclear plants are necessary, in Italy we don't have it but we buy loads of energy from France that produces it with that."
"Everything will be still available just to super wealthy who will have no carbon limit. Rest of us will be locked in 15min towns forever like life stock. No escape, no protest, fast cancellation if no obey"
"Having worked in the clean energy and renewables space for many years,  I’ve seen a lot of misinformation touted in these interviews. Renewables are an intermittent source of energy. When comparing the price of renewables to other sources like baseload nuclear or fossil fuel energy generators, you need to look at the total system costs. These system costs include the transmission infrastructure needed to transport energy to consumers, and also the enormous amount of storage that’s needed when the renewables aren’t generating anything. If you include the cost of all this extra infrastructure, it is much higher than the cost consumers currently paid for their existing baseload generators. Moreover, the area footprint for renewable generation is much larger and conventional based generators. We need to ask ourselves where we’re going to get all the necessary minerals to realise these nets zero fantasies by governments where are we going to get a cobalt, nickel vanadium, silver?? There aren’t enough known reserves for these minerals at the present time? All these discussions about sustainable aviation, fuels are fanciful. Here, again. You need to look at the total system costs, which include harvesting all the biomass and organic resources, transport, costs and refining costs. How much landmass are we going to have to commit for these biomass fuels? And is that the most sustainable outcome for this biomass?"
"The 1st world, including China, is facing a population collapse starting in 2030. As the population collapses so too will carbon emission. Extreme elderly and dead people do not drive cars, they do not go to work, they are not consumers. The Carbon Driven Climate Change will correct itself, even if we do absolutely nothing. So why are we trying to bankrupt our countries driving inflation through the roof. Just stop it will all be corrected in 20 years."

"""Renewable"" is kinda BS.. entropy always increases, it never decreases. So all energy being used is never to be renewed, you just always tap into other energy never in the same again.

But there's energy that is NOT primary source but draws from another source, on our planet apart from geothermal that's basically always the sun.

Oil, Gas, Wind, Solar, it is all the same, it has as primary source the sun! Very simple, and the sun doesn't renew, as such it is NEVER renewable.

Saying this as an Engineer.

I wish people filled with hatred, racism and fascism like Greta Thunberg and other low-educated people with low IQ would stop making bold claims and just stick to the facts."

"The entire country of Portugal ran solely on renewable energy for six days in a row in November 2023.
Portugal produced 1102 GWh of renewable energy from wind, hydropower and sun, surpassing its demand of 840 GWh, which allowed it to even export electricity to Spain. It’s a record.
About 60% of Portugal’s energy comes from renewable sources today and is expected to run 100% on renewables before 2045."

"Bla bla bla. Woke. Gay guys but most troubling

"Interesting. Burning wood waste (biomass) is considered renewable energy and lumped in with solar, wind, hydro and geothermal. Perhaps we need to talk more about emission-free energy since burning biomass puts CO2 and other combustion by-products directly into the atmosphere, rather than keeping it sequestered for decades in a forest that actually continuously captures CO2 & stores it? (Sure, trees eventually die and slowly release their stored carbon, but burning them is quick release and growing a new tree large enough to sequester the same amount of carbon as a mature tree takes decades.)

Calling wood burning renewable energy is technically correct but still undesirable for a variety of reasons. (Notice how smooth a politician is at dodging direct questions. It's a job requirement, apparently...)

Truth be told, it is almost impossible for us to reach our global temperature targets in time, and we might not even be able to slow the increases in GHG emissions from global economic development impacts significantly. Sure, governments will trumpet the increasing percentage of energy that comes from renewables, but they will avoid discussing the growing overall global demand for energy and the increased fossil fuel consumption that will meet much of that new demand.

The handwriting is on the wall, and all the greenwashing that sales & marketing and politicians can muster won't change the trajectory of global GHG emissions & global temperature increases. Doesn't mean we shouldn't deploy as much emission-free renewables as we can, but that shouldn't make us feel like the problem is being handled and we should just consume on without taking effective, quantifiable actions in our personal lifestyles."

"We really have to ponder this: why do the UK citizens pay a few times MORE than most people in the world when the renewables can now be even cheaper than energy from fossil fuels? To put it into perspective, in some Asian countries that only use natural gas to generate electricity, they pay only 10-12p per kwh (without standing charge) while we are paying bloody 27p per kwh + 35-40p standing charge per day! How could ours be that expensive?
There must be something wrong with our system! Our government must fix this or everyone in the UK will continue to suffer badly, both socially and economically."
The battery is better and better. Electric motors is the best for the good of our mother earth.
"Where is the dividing line betweenhuman caused and natural Climate Change. Without that knowledge all the crap being spread means absolutely nothing. If the speed linit is 80 mph you know the deviding line between a speeding ticket and getting home in time for dinner is at 80 mph 
So when any of these climateers claim it's ""HUMAN CAUSED"" it means absolutely nothing because there is no indication of what and how much is natural causes.
Natural Causes like 1000's of undersea volcanoes or the increase of the population from 2.5 billion to 8 billion in just 60 years.
How is Lightning generated forest fire ""Human Caused?""...These wannabe climateers don't have the sense of pocket lint. Without Carbon, we're all dead.......only an idiot can't understand that.
Not to mention there is no TECHNOLOGY available on earth that provide and average temperature. Earth has 200 million sq miles of are. 71% of that is ocean. Everything thats water, wind, gravity and sunlight are in constant motion every millisecond of time. When some one claims 1.5 inches of sea level change, it's a good bet they know nothing.
Temperture ...look at it with your own eyes on the weather channels. In one city it change from area to area by 8 or 10 degrees between breakfast and dinner. How can you possibly get an average of 1.5 degrees.
There is a serious mental absence here"

"Great video on renewable energy! I highly recommend the Segway Portable PowerStation Cube Series for outdoor enthusiasts like us. It has massive capacity, fast recharging, and versatile sockets. Plus, it's waterproof and has comprehensive protections. Check it out for reliable power during your camping trips or as a backup at home."
I am none the wiser as to whether the world can rely on renewable energy. Lot's of cool tech here but no real numbers on how scaleable they are 🤷
"Of course.  It is just a matter of time.

Regeneratives are available right now, and would greatly accelerate an all-sustainables global economy. 

The build out of primary inputs will take some time.  But, at some point renewables heavy energy production would be the norm."
"The challenge of climate change and the energy transition is not the 'how' or the 'cost' but politics and nay sayers who fear change and are the target of lobby groups. Just think about this. It is cheaper to build a solar / wind with pv storage solution that generates the same amount of power than to run a equivalent capacity gas powerplant for 1 year. Think about it. How much you hate change, that is so absurdly cheap that even the most climate critical political party cannot ignore it. So what about intermittency in winter and at night? Easy we just build 7x the capacity of the fossil fuel counterparts. We would make that money back in 7 years! And the added bonus: if the wind is blowing and the sun is shining: energy will be near free. The biggest problem: What company would build so many renewables if you cant charge for it when they are generating the most? Companies will not do it, governments will need to do it. The energy transformation will shift the power from energy companies back to gouverments and the economy will be booming because power will be almost free.... The energy transition challenge is the people who are opposed to change. We need to convince people to accept the change and see the potential."

"For the metane emission, Dairy/beef industries should have been mention since they are the greatest emitors by far."

"Nice, but greenwash from the aviation industry.  What needs to be said is 'we need to fly less' - but will an industry based on making profit from air transport ever say 'consume less to reduce the footprint'?"
Looking forward to seeing how the nuclear industry returns in strength with small modular reactors. I'm also happy to see Airbus developing hydrogen powered airplanes. We can produce the hydrogen for free from nuclear power plants!
"Never fly, walk take public transport, phone, go online for conferences.  There is no way for many-many decades to fly without destroying the planet.  There is hope in the return of airships.  Canceling methane is a hopeful move.  I doubt if renewables can do the job by   themselves.  Modular nuclear is now cheaper and safer.  fossil fuels kills 8.1 million people every year then hurricanes, wild fires, floods kills and uproots many more.  Killing more indirectly by the loss of crops so by starvation.  There is some greenwash in this programme.  If we don't face the gravity and difficulties of the climate catastrophe honestly we will not solve it."
Millions of years ago dinosaurs farted methane that set the world on fire.
Delta is full of it. Greenwashing. They're not the only airline at this either.
"No increase in hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, heatwaves, floods, droughts, climate migrants, sea levels, Polar melting, or species extinction, because of CO2, which a negligible amount is caused by humans. A huge increase in crops production, and the Earth greening, thanks to CO2......... there is no ""Climate Crisis""........ I am not a bot with several subscribers and no content, I have a channel where I show my face!. There is no such thing as ""Green Energy"""
There’s thousands of them all the us and by law 3:19 3:20 the oil companies only have to deal with a few every year
"There is no climate emergency, CO2 is not causing warming of the planet. Go research the heat forcing properties of CO2, it’s a minor inefficient greenhouse gas. Stop swallowing what the media feeds you. Do your own research!!"
Are there enough raw materials for renewables?
Just stop flying 🤷🏻‍♂️. Use zoom or take a train.
"We do not have the time with renewables after 20yrs of wind & solar energy failure.  Climate change and CO2 can be reduced quickly with new nuclear, but the old extremist/populist anti-nuclear groups are  the problem to solving climate change and the green parties do not have the solutions.  Many green parties build new fossil fuel gas/coal because renewables requires two energy systems due to their low output and unreliability.  But this dual renewable energy system (wind/solar with gas/coal in via the backdoor) is never properly counted from a cost perspective.  Look at New York, closed nuclear increased CO2 with more gas power.  Renewables not working.   The largest wind farm in Europe has gone bankrupt, environmental damage from wind plants in the sea poison the food chain with microplastics from the turbine blades, solar needs batteries but the promised battery technology does not appear.  You pick a solar plant, but do not pick the solar plant which went bankrupt, https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/americas-concentrated-solar-power-companies-have-all-but-disappeared.  Be honest, stop peddling failed fake old renewable promises, go for new nuclear.  70% nuclear, 20% hydro, 10% solar/wind.  We need new solutions, not old renewables, fossil free power, like Sweden.  Drop the fake renewable failures.  Then we can have a clean, happy planet with nature protected from the wind & solar industry environmental damage."
Unfortunately every watt of alleged green power has to be backed up with fossil fuel as if you don't you have power cuts as proven in the UK when it was tried. So not only do you have to manufacture the reusable equipment thay are actually increasing pollution as there's on way to guarantee power with out fossil fuel & we are burning fossil fuel & not using it just wasting it.
"Burlington might have 100% renewable energy, but it is far from zero carbon emissions. In fact with one third of its electricity coming from burning biomass, it is in fact a big emitter of greenhouse gases."
"What about pollution from so called renewables? For eg solar panels, EV batteries, bio diesel etc?
What about fossil fuels spent by the world leaders and their camp followers jetting around, staying in seven star hotels, attending conferences to save the world? 
This is only fun and frolic for leaders who achieve little but know how to enjoy life by staying in power. Climate change is a real threat but the solution prescribed is worse than the decease.
Solution lies in reversing population growth in the third world countries. Our planet simply can’t support eight billion people. Polluters are nations in the Middle East, Indian subcontinent & Africa."

"It's a bit of a half truth that renewables are cheaper than conventional alternatives.

Yeah it's cheaper, if you don't include the necessary storage, transmission and nation wide interconnectivity needed to reduce storage needs.

It's akin to me selling you the cheapest house on the market, but failing to disclose it still needs a roof and foundation"
"Wow, what a puff peace.  There is no serious journalism here."
Top stuff - great that you managed to be positive for almost half an hour. That's a refreshing change in this sphere 👏👏👏
"How do we run farm tractors, not with solar or wind power."
"Renewable are not solution because they also pollute the environment and are not totally free of pollution 
Therefore it is necessary to live very simple life like before people lived before the industrial revolution times 
And also another thing which is extremely necessary is to reduce the population of the word 
And it is also very necessary to end capitalism and shift to bio economy or circular economy . 
There must be no joke with the planet EARTH"
"With global temperatures hitting record highs, and extreme weather events affecting people around the globe, this year’s UN climate change conference, COP28, is a pivotal opportunity to correct course and accelerate action to tackle the climate crisis. COP28 is where the world will take stock of progress on the Paris Agreement – the landmark climate treaty concluded in 2015 – and chart a course of action to dramatically reduce emissions and protect lives and livelihoods."

"More hymns and catechisms from old beeb on our apparent new global religion of climate change. 🙄Keeping with the style of a uselessly dull religious service, the reporting isn't even GOOD, it's a cobbled together bunch of B-roll with each ""story"" having about the same depth as a sidewalk puddle. The presenter clearly is painfully clueless about a number of the technologies shown and seems to care about the topics even less than he understands them. This kind of bilge epitomizes why I practically never pay any attention to legacy media anymore."

"What a load of horse 💩.  Human influence is miniscule on the planet.   We are experiencing a change in the climate because the planets tilt and wobble is starting it's 20,000 year change in position. Which is fact documented in geology, earth and ice samples.  For example north Africa, the Sahara was green and wet 20,000 years ago and then the planets tilt and wobble changed and it dried up.  What is happening now 20,000 years later it is starting to get flooding rain in areas that hasn't had such rain in human memory.  That's nothing to do with mankind making any impact."

We already got pass the 2*C increase - world needs tidal power more than solar or coal.
"Renewable energy, and reaching net zero, currently, there is a lot of effort put into persuading people to buy electric cars, and install heat pumps, while these attempts may be 
done with the best of intensions, but unfortunately this is the equivalent to putting the (cart before the horse) If everyone switched over in the next few years, the only way we 
have of suppling enough electricity to power all these devices, would be to pump more natural gas through our gas powered generating plants.

I believe that our top priority should be to build much more renewable energy generating Capacity, together with energy storage, because energy storage is the key to making any 
Renewable energy system a realistic alternative to fossil fuels.

But how much more renewable energy generating capacity do we need? I say 50% more than would be needed on a typical day, so that the surplus can be stored as Green chemical 
energy, probably Green Hydrogen for days when the sun does not shine, and the wind does not blow, but also, as fuel for heavy vehicles, ships, planes and anything else were batteries 
or a cable would not be appropriate.

For most of the world, renewable energy will be in the form of solar or wind, but in some places wave or tidal energy would be an option and a few places will have the option of a 
base load generated by nuclear, but most will need some form of energy storage, luckily there is a huge range of options trying to get your attention, from a variety of battery types, 
from sodium-ion or sulphur variants, redox flow batteries, Nickel Hydrogen, to domes filled with CO2 as part of a compressed gas system, but not lithium-ion batteries, which keep 
getting more expensive due to rarity of the materials they are made from, plus, there is environmental damage caused by the mining and processing of these materials, then there 
are the slightly unusual options employing the raising and lowering of weights to store energy.

Then there is long-term storage, for when the wind and the sun don’t play ball for days or even weeks at a time. Every winter the U.K. is subject to meteorological weather events, 
known as a blocking high pressure system, which can last for up to two weeks at a time, and they usually come complete with a blanket of cloud, which further reduces an already 
limited amount of light for solar panels, plus there is little, or no wind for the wind turbines, leaving us with just nuclear power stations, that supply only 30% of our energy needs, 

which will go nowhere near meeting our energy demands, put simply we need a system that can store and supply between 60 to 70% of our energy needs for up to a month each 
winter, only a chemical storage system, such as green Hydrogen would have the capacity to storage energy for such a period, if we are not to fall back onto fossil fuels.

It has been suggested that large scale energy storage is unnecessary, and that we should rely on interconnectors under the sea to transfer electricity backwards and forwards 
between ourselves and Europe, on the assumption that some part of Europe will always have a surplus we can use, but I can see a scenario where eastern Europe is suffering a 
winter cold snap and needs all the energy it can get, Britain and the low countries are stuck under a blocking high pressure system, so no wind, plus Spain and Portugal are covered by 
rain bearing cloud, so minimal solar power, and such a situation would not be that unusual, and given recent developments with the war in Ukraine to satisfy a small man’s ego,
 it would be extremely unwise to assume that our partners in Europe will always be willing, or even able to supply us with what we want, when we want it, generating and storing our 
own surplus energy, means we stay in control. Interconnectors under the sea would be nice to have but should not be relied upon. 

 Another idea doing the rounds, says we build the bare minimum amount of renewable Capacity, and use smart technology to switch on or off an internet of things, as a way of 
balancing supply and demand, where large tech companies would control the operation of everything from large factories, to your domestic washing machine or fridge, I believe this is 
a distraction, I believe that the big technology companies could build such a smart system,  but I also believe that the tech companies already have too much control over our lives, and 
I believe our goal should be to build 50% more renewable capacity than we need, so the excess can be stored, and we do not have to rely on a smart system that could be hacked."
This is the third video I've seen today making promises that won't be kept. The doomers are starting to get people worried. Good. People need to be worried and not lulled into continuing business as usual.

"People talk soooo much. Net Zero and what not... But in reality the co2 ppm is rising, like it always did. Nothing in that ever changed since mankind invented the combustion engine. And as poor nations develop, they use all technology they can, for the little money they have. That only means more emissions.
And that only means, the co2 ppm will keep on rising. Even if it will rise slower, it will still keep rising. No one ever talks about that. Ye I wonder why."
In my area a old pipe line was cut and since nothing seemed to be coming out they simply burried the cut pipe next to the house they were building.  Of course a house with the family in it blewup killing the family.  Developers are still resisting regulations restriting building on top of old oil fields.
"There is a difference between renewable energy and emission-free energy.  Bio-fuel emits CO2 and other bad stuff.  We need to transition to 100% emission-free, basically solar, wind, and batteries (SWB).  When I got going in climate change, renewable sounded great.  In fact, I founded a group called Renewable Taos.  As time went on and we made local progress, we realized that we really need to focus on emission-free.  That is the only proper focus to avert catastrophic climate change.  It's a transition, so bio-fuels have some reason.  But, they are actually very dirty.  SWB is the actual solution.  Cooking oil and ethanol are actually bad sources of energy."
"I don't know about saying Burlington is 100% renewable, this only seems to refer to the electricity grid, not transport, also not city heating according to one website, whatever that means exactly, might be a lot in their climate. Transport is usually around 30% of emissions. If they had gotten everyone to buy an electric car they would have mentioned that somewhere surely, this would cut transport emissions to about half, 15%, still perhaps not enough. 
It is common to talk about being 100% renewable without counting transport, this seems rather self-deluding avoiding addressing the probable need for walkable, ""15 minute"", cities or communities bypassing transport where possible."
Hi All think on this wind and solar are green right ? Sorry wrong green means no landfill issues . But it works you say !! Well no it is the wrong type we need Baseload instant reliable feed power . now i am all for green but if it ends in landfill in part or hole then its not green. So how about the idea that all the dams that are not green due to the concrete are made to make more power? It can be made all have only one bank of turbines that can now change to three banks in some cases. Yet no one is doing it why Because of you not pushing thing .

He is so cereal!
"Why don't the climatists provide an in depth explanation of how CO2 works? CO2 absorbs/emits IR at 15um, which translates to a Plank blackbody temperature of -80C. 15um IR can't warm anything up higher than -80C. Ask them why what they say doesn't violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics?"

"back when al gore was a senator in tennessee i found out that he, christopher reeves and tommy lee jones were all friends in college. i think everyone loved superman and later on i thought al gore looked like superman too! he is very environmentally aware of what we should do for the planet. it's not so much his private jet...it's oil & gas and chemical companies that pollute so much. Monsanto doesn't help by mowing down the amazon..."

Makes more sense that the sun causes climate change and the orbit. Nothing Al says makes sense when you look at the climate through out history. This guy profits off non-sense. You’re stunned you wouldn’t even notice a change even if humans were gone tomorrow. The ocean would cool causing hot air to rise over thousands of years. C02 is needed for life. You’re a joke you think it’s the big petro companies LOL they are the ones who own the renewable 😂mercy company’s show me your credentials explain to me how CO2 causes a green how effect you have no clue lol
We found out this very week that Alberta's sands oil exploitation is actually 64 more times polluting (air and water) than initially claimed by the industry.
Its been manbearpig the whole time
"COP28
Where a bunch of rich people fly their private jets half way around the world to talk about how bad it is to spew CO2 into the atmosphere.  All during a period of time in hisotry where technology allows us to speak to almost anyone, anywhere on the planet with the touch of a button.  But you know, still have to fly those private jets!!!  They ain't gonna fly themselves!!  
1 private jet trip to COP28 puts more CO2 into the atmosphere than the average person does in an entire year, but you're the problem."
Stop Climate change by reading the bible where it clearly states that its happening because some got greedy for gain.  Might be time to not be the one to make and keep and love the lie. The earth languishes when his anointed ones languish and the quicker the lie end the better....

"Mr Gore's energy speeches are so inspirational and inspiring! Too bad that he doesn't follow his own advice! He tells us, you need to start using less  energy/ electricity in order to save the planet! While most American families use 10-11 thousand kilowatts of electricity each year on average. Mr Gore's electric bill averages 19,241 kilowatts per month!! He tells us to cut back, Go Green, while he's living the high life!! Check it out for yourself. He uses more kilowatts of electricity in a month than most of us do in a year! It's all a freaking sack of cow FARTS! 🐄🎉"
"Hey AL, how many times did you go to the Island???"

"Tom Nelson's channel is an excellent source of interviews with relevant scientists and academics who entirely disagree with this mainstream narrative largely founded on highly questionable ""evidence"" - which is why reading the actual climategate emails is so important - because then you get to see all the main players arguing with each other how to conceal what many of them knew to be true - that their work was flawed and had never been checked, not even by one another, never mind independently - and they made it as hard as possible for that to be done by anyone daring to question their authority, and by trying to undermine the peer review process - Anyone can read their actual arguments, blaming one another for this catastrophe, coniving ways to impede investigation or to shut up desenting voices within their own relatively small community of scientists.   You have to read what they actually said to understand what they were trying to hide and how they succeeded - otherwise we wouldn't be subject to this same garbage years later.   You can find the emails at Lavoisier .  If it were fiction it would read like a great novel - but it's real and quite unbelievable how they behaved.   It tells you more than any interview can but if you enjoy interviews on this matter then I can also recommend Tom Nelson's channel with 186 interviews and counting."

Epstein Island AL.  Why did you go
"Lets switch back to global heating and or cooling.  Can we just do that so we can move on from the future of carbon taxation and higher living costs for nothing.  Planets self balance, more co2 more trees ect unless you inhibit the balancing systems.  Gore was wrong and its just an elitist push for Communism and global governance in the future and higher and higher taxes and fees."
Al Gore is full of 💩💩💩💩! The American people know about Gore and have proof of his nonsense. Congress enacted the Weather engineered control in 1976. This is Lyndon B Johnson's baby!

I prefer to believe that he has no clue on climate."
Sicka pajaser
"Well, you can change, but you have to honest. In my view, Al is lying about the cause of climate change. So let's start with the elephant in the room. Fossil fuel do not exist. Firstly, there's no proof that rotting dinasaurs created oil and gas, and almost half of the hydrocarbons we produce, are not used as fuels. So, no fossils, and no excluve use of hydrocarbons as fuel. Check your clothing tags, if it says something like polyester, nylon, spandex.....etc. then you're wearing oil! The roads you drive on are built using the waste produced in an oil distillation column. Wind turbine blades, solar panels, batteries for EV's all require oil, hydrocarbons. And, turbine blades, solar panels and many other engineering materials cannot be recycled. Let's mine some more!!

So, let's quote the ""scientists"": Climate change is caused by human activity. So more human activity = more climate change. I fail to see how hydrocarbons are causing climate change. It's caused by human beings, the greatest pest this poor planet had ever to contend with! So.....

Maybe if you stop having so many babies, we wouldn't change the climate. That's easy to understand. I don't have any children and I never will. Who else have made that sacrifice? Certainly not Al, he's got 4 kids! Thanks for helping to over populate the earth, Al. Thanks for contributing so staunchily to increase climate change! 

Ok, let the haters respond, I'm waiting!"
this guy sounds like a used furniture salesman . these people are so full of it . record heat my ass . start by leading the way gore . show us how its done I bet you won't cut your carbon footprint down . NON OF THEM DO  they just scold us .
"Ill believe al gore when he gets his electric bill down to. $100 like mine is! In other words, I'll never believe al gore!"
"Gotta love the intro..”He runs a NON-PROFIT.” 😂🤣😂😂(BTW, the planet is in its NATURAL part of its warming curve. Has around another 1.5 degrees to go before the cooling begins in several years. Look up the REAL science, LEMMINGS.)"
Could someone please ask Al Gore if a single prediction he has made has come true. He stays rich with groundhog year and groundhog decade repeated spewing of nonsense.
What we need to do is quit lying to people. In the 20 years nothing has changed.  It was not the hottest. M who are the experts and what did the report say.  Net zero means 50% of the people die of starvation.  Ev are only 5% of car sales no one wants them. What a loser. Can anyone find the documents on the 97% of scientists believe in climate change? What the question were. Who funded the research and what was the education of the scientists?  Ask your self who is making money off this and then you will find the truth
For these climate change crazy people  to be sucessful in their mission they first have to make you afraid. Next they must get you to panic and third they must get you to believe and join their group. Kerry and Gore have become experts at this con job called climate change. This is what China and Osama  Bin Laden tried to do to America.  Destroy America  from the inside out.

"The world needs to reject rich greedy politicians who profit from fear like Al Gore does. Crude oil, or long chain hydrocarbons is not ""fossil fuels"". Oil companies know this, but to them, it's not worth the fight."
"There has been no increase in hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, wildfires, heatwaves, glacial melting, sea ice extent, or surface temperatures. The greening around the planet and total leaf coverage is larger than the Amazon, deforestation, has been outpaced by new growth. CO2 is chiefly responsible for the over 100% increase in the top ten major crop yields per acre. Humans are responsible for a minuscule amount of that highly beneficial CO2. The climate has always changed, and deranged talk about giant space mirrors, carbon capture, aerosol injection, and destroying millions of acres for toxic solar farms and equally useless wind turbines that are short lived, require lubrication, requires continuous maintenance,  destroys forests and like solar panels do not get recycled, are absolutely mindless proposals ( could have used one word, but that would get me banned from YT for hurting someone's feelings). There is no such thing as green energy, and depriving developing countries of cheap, abundant fossil fuels is consigning them to eternal poverty! This guy does not care, he is rich and makes his money off of politically driven and funded programs, he is driving an agenda. Folks...... there is no ""Climate Crisis"" I have a face, I have a channel, I have uploaded content, I am not a bot! 2023 was not even close to the hottest year on record."
Climate change is a scam and I make sure to tell (detail) everyone around me it is. Follow the money (like anything) and you will see the evolution of this hoax.
Maybe if rich people like Gore did not have giant mansions and stopped flying around on private jets it would help.
There is man made deliberate climate change and its called chem trails. They are modifying and playing god with the weather in order to manipulate you and take total control of your life.
Al is very overfed.
Remember when they locked the world down for virus? We they locked the third-world down longer than the industrial world so it would FORCE them to migrate to the industrial world. Then they blammed this migration on climate change. This is a UN Agenda to collapse the industrial world using REPLACEMENT migration to destroy nation states.
"Much as I approve of Al Gore's attempts to stop greenhouse gas emissions by using alternative energy resources, we don't know if 'net zero' will stop global warming 'right away'? Although I am not a climate scientist, I believe the oceans function as a vast heat sink? Thanks to 2 centuries of heating, our oceans could continue to contribute to global warming for decades or even centuries to come, even after reaching net zero?"

forests depend on that storm debris
As mudanças climáticas (ventos.... derretimento do permafrost.... temperaturas extremas)estão quase que invisíveis para a maioria das pessoas elas nem percebem a catástrofe que se aproxima.... quando as consequências chegarem será tarde demais para todos nós.......
You can't resist change😂 let it go .... we are only passing by this 🌎 😂
Stop growing flowers. Grow food ffs.
Nature takes care of itself adding sands because you build litterly on the beach 😅smh lack of insects because you take food
I find the fact that those particular winds at about ten thousand feet are just about the same height as thousands of large aircraft are criss crossing the  skies 24 hours a day  ???
"Climate change is always a localized event, while global warming is, well, a global phenomenon! How a single global event causes the variety of local events? 

This video is totally IPCC’s propaganda. Wind is driven by the solar energy, it is running like a heat engine, converting the solar energy into kinetic energy, and dumping waste thermal energy into the cooler zones and outer space. 

The climate of a planet is a thermodynamic system, which requires the right set of knowledge (thermodynamics) to study! None of the IPCC’s activist scientists possess the knowledge!"
Sail boats are gona be soon fast.. gona be awesome
"Wow, climates change.  Who would have ever thought?"
One trip in an aircraft from London to New York produces the same amount of pollution that a car does over 40 years. Perspective works wonders on the shallow mind.
"this climate change narrative is nonsense but it does have a reason. Those who consider themselves in charge of the world are trying to force people into having no cars, no holidays in the sun, no meat eating, etc. Eventually they will kill off billions of us through starvation. They will do this by stopping farmers producing food using the nonsense about climate change to throw farmers off their land. This is already happening and it is not because they are concerned about the planet, it is to kill us. Face up to it or starve to death, your choice. What is killing forests? Pollution definitely but that is done by corporations and the rich using private jets. We must stop polluting that is true but the truth behind the climate change narrative has nothing to do with concern for the environment."

I live in Australia and due to all the trees being removed and climate change the wind is insane. It is so windy where I live they won't build wind turbines
"Yea, many people still dont believe, our planet getting warmer, and we have huge changes in it.. I allredy see whitout any documentary that fact, we will no survive later if we dont make changes.."

FAKE WEATHER NEWS"
"In the current global situation it is now way too late to even attempt reversal or amelioration of the atmosphere. Even if every human carbon source was stopped, global warming will continue at the same rate and is accelerating daily. There are now millions of tons of both CO2 and CH4 being released into the Arctic atmosphere (the reason the Arctic has heated quicker than any other region in recent years) The wild fires in both canada and Siberia that are burning acre upon acre of the Taiga belt are also exacerbating permafrost melt. The fires regularly ignite CH4 pockets just beneath the surface which in turn makes more fire. The melting of the parmafrost has passed the tipping point. It has entered a feedback loop that will continue regardless of human atmospheric CO2. When CO2 reached 350pppm it was already too late as the global warming baton had been passed to CH4 whic is a far more volatile greenhouse gas than CO2 - one molecule of CH4 being equivalent to about 25 of CO2. Although CH4 has a much shorter life span it's volatility is far more atmospherically destructive than CO2, which, even in the short term makes Arctic warming totally irreversible.There are also millions of tons of CH4 escaping from the oceans from melting methane hydrates on the sea floor. These are not being affected by atmosphere but under sea floor heating due to rising mantle plumes. Please research the rise in 'deep quakes' in the South Pacific. They have increased expnentially due to massive magmatic movement in the mantle. In late 2021 there was a Mag 8 deep quake beneath Fiji. A short while later another Mag 7 beneath Tonga and then shortly after  the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai volcano erupted in the most violent explosion for many years. It has caused a rise in both earth movement and volcanism around the ring of fire both west and east. The only places yet unaffected are the Cascadia fault line and the Californian fault system. Research the 12,000 year universal cycle. The weather will be the least of the planetary problems that face the human race."

"Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland study what drives the polar Aurora was limited by resource or knowledge about the origin of charged particles  blamed it on solar wind. It was half correct. 

Our solar system received what we call solar wind is actually is cosmic wind of charged particles current pass on to its residence stars through the Orion-Cygnus Arm of the Milky Way. After received it through the polar regions our sun in turn pass it on its sibling planets including earth. 

This energy currently is responsible for : earth spin and direction, jet stream and direction, hurricane and tornadoes, seismic activities, geothermal etc. 

What our weather scientists didn’t appreciate it are limited to study the effect of that with a technique known as numerical modeling and intense computation."

Very interest documentary explain a complex thing in simple way .
"It takes 3 units of energy to create enough hydrogen to store 1 unit of energy. 3 to 1. Surely that in itself is enough to take hydrogen off the table in favour of battery storage for everything except aviation, fertiliser and specialised chemical  industries relying on it."
Global renewables reducing supply and driving prices much higher. Simple facts.
Interesting
The idea that we can create a sustainable economy while also continuing to pursue endless growth and endlessly grow GDP is utter madness what we need to be doing is finding an appropriate level of material use based in a circular economy where GDP is not tied to consumption but on circular material use.  How economies of the future need to be measure is not by how much they consume but how much waste is generated and how much new material input is necessary to maintain a high standard of living for all citizens of the earth. right now we measure economy by how much it consumes and we measure that as a sign of progress this is fundamentally backwards. it should be how little is necessary to maintain a circular system materials which can not be easily reused will eventually need to phased out.

"28:08 Which is a stupid idea wherever it isn't absolutely necessary because it is EXTREMELY inefficient.

For staters carbon capture is already extremely difficult and very energy intensive, then you have to combine the captured carbon with hydrogen which (you guessed it) is very difficult and energy intensive just to then put it in an engine to make it explode in order to get the energy back out which is _(drumroll)_ actually very easy, just woefully inefficient in and off itself but combined with the inevitable cumulative inefficiencies all those conversion processes you might as well make a fire in the garden to heat up stones to then throw in water which you'll then use to heat your home..."

"Where does Lancaster get its electricity at night? 
Where would every city get its electricity at night if all cities were solar power the city by day? 
Would larger power plants just wait around for an evening request. How does that change the economic viability of an under-utilized power plant. Why does this documentary not discuss this issue?
Like most Californians, as long as China emits the CO2 to build their solar panels. Producing Solar panels is exceptionally energy intensive and includes the use of coal. 
The problem with DC under-sea cables interconnecting parts of Europe is that most countries have excess electricity at the same time, and a shortage at the same time, last year, the UK paid millions of dollars to other countries for  taking the excess energy. Great idea, pay Norway to take excess energy, Norway save its Hydro energy for a later date, and just one component of this project is 30 Billion Euros. 
This documentary is just one side of the story, the feel good side. 
David Turver, 
It is crystal clear that interconnectors do not provide cheaper energy. In fact, quite the opposite is true. The data shows that interconnectors have helped us (UK) to perfect the art of buying high and selling low. The price we pay for imports is consistently above the market price and the price we get for exports is significantly below market rates and we frequently pay others to take surplus power off our hands. In what world does it make economic sense for consumers to pay elevated subsidies to generate wind and solar power, and then pay people overseas to take the same power off our hands"
It's only profitable because energy is really free and people are just robbing us
What do you do with all the waste when the solar panels go bad they have problems recycling those things
This Video was Good Until I saw the wood Burning not a good thing to Burn Anything
"The amount of hydrogen needed to replace a conventional power plant depends on several factors, including the power plant's capacity, efficiency, and the energy content of hydrogen. 

1. **Power Plant Capacity:** Consider the capacity of the conventional power plant you want to replace. Power plants are often rated in terms of megawatts (MW) or gigawatts (GW).

2. **Efficiency of Hydrogen Conversion:** Hydrogen can be used in different ways to generate electricity, such as through hydrogen fuel cells or hydrogen combustion. The efficiency of these processes can vary.

3. **Energy Content of Hydrogen:** Hydrogen has an energy content usually measured in megajoules per kilogram (MJ/kg) or gigajoules per kilogram (GJ/kg), depending on the unit of measurement.

Once you have these parameters, you can calculate the amount of hydrogen needed using the following general formula:

\[ \text{Hydrogen Needed (in kg)} = \frac{\text{Electricity Needed (in MWh)}}{\text{Efficiency of Hydrogen Conversion}} \times \frac{1}{\text{Energy Content of Hydrogen (in MJ or GJ per kg)}} \]

This calculation provides an estimate of the mass of hydrogen required to generate a certain amount of electricity with a specific efficiency.

It's important to note that transitioning from a conventional power plant to a hydrogen-based system involves various technical, economic, and infrastructure considerations. Hydrogen production, storage, and distribution infrastructure need to be developed, and the overall feasibility depends on the specific context and goals of the energy transition. 😊😊😊 chatGPT!!!!"

"The entire country of Portugal ran solely on renewable energy for six days in a row.
Portugal produced 1102 GWh of renewable energy from wind, hydropower and sun, surpassing its demand of 840 GWh, which allowed it to even export electricity to Spain. It’s a record.
About 60% of Portugal’s energy comes from renewable sources today and is expected to run 100% on renewables before 2045."
But what happens with Norwegian oil and gas after 2030 ?  XD
Renwables are the future. We need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels from  dictatorships

Informative video
"I strongly believe that it will be more profitable for the entire planet to invest in circular economy rather than using every drop of petroleum... what if that effort is direct to increase renewable sources of energy, what if we reduce energy comsumption what if we support other strategies... we must undertand that we live in the same planet and we use the same resources, its not about money, it is about life for everyone!"
"Thank you, it’s very informative and actual"
agreed
Looks great! Developing countries need to find a way to utilize this!
"The problem is that the rate of warming today is so rapid that plants and animals cannot migrate, adapt and evolve rapidly enough. Since humans have been, are and always will be totally dependent upon the functional heath and capacity of our ecological life-support system for our own heath and survival, and since wild plants and animals can’t just run into an AC room to avoid a protracted heat wave, my prediction is that it will take active participation of humans in the for of genetic engineering, ecological restoration and enhancement to adapt to the coming greenhouse Earth. I expect that this job and other geoengineering jobs will be the top and the highest paying jobs of the coming century. I further predict that the necessity for action and the wealth that these people will accumulate will force society to acknowledge ecological literacy as literacy, to acknowledge that humans are part of the ecosystem, stimulate the development of ecologically-based and ecologically-constrained technology and the creation of an ecologically-based and ecologically-constrained economy. This will of course not occur without a fight as there are some who want to see business as usual and global warming continue, these people want to see the exodus and evacuation of uninhabitable areas of the planet because they see it as an opportunity to mine such areas for their mineral wealth with robots. These are the same people who are arguing for Overshoot, so that they can profit from correcting the very externalities that they caused. And they want us to pay them to do it too!"
"Oil production should continue but the oil so obtained should not be burned so as to create GHGs. Rather, it should be used to make Carbon fiber cables for space freight elevators to get all polluting industrial processes out of the habitable zone of our planet and out into space. The habitable zone of the planet should then be reserved exclusively for humans and other living species. With available habitat restored, the ecosystem can then soak up all the excess Carbon that we have dumped into it into the standing stock of plant and animal biomass. (The reason that it is accumulating in the atmosphere and the oceans is because it is not accumulating in the standing stock of biomass fast enough). Ecological restoration and enhancement will require humans to function in their proper and intended roles as the keystone species and stewards of the planet. They should be paid a highly respectable wage for their vitally important work. Let's get started!"
Wonderful

"The motto of this documentary should be: ""Anything but nuclear"". All you're expressing here are ideas that could potentially work at some point, not right now, when we need solutions. Nothing concrete. Nuclear power works, has been working for decades, and is available right now. Renewables are inefficient alone at this point, and wishful thinking won't change this reality, no matter how many pretty ideas and pretentious words you put into documentaries."
Swapping out PC boards for solutions in correction of Nuclear.
This is really a great documentary.
"That is one powerful statement, We didn't inherit this planet from our parents, we're borrowing it from our children :"")"
Thank you :)
"In Bangladesh, solar panels are kind of mandatory in villages. But people buy for a few months when they build their houses. Later on, they sell ."
It already is too late.
"""We didn't inherit this planet from our parents, we're borrowing it from our children.""
What a powerful yet touching statement..."

"No will not stop!!!
Will create more comfort in chaos yes!!!"
Thanks DW
Here’s a brilliant idea- let’s transport wood pellets across the entire ocean to England to run a power plant.. burning millions of gallons of diesel fuel to all to make the claim that it’s powered from renewable “biomass.”  We won’t even factor in all the diesel used to truck said wood pellets from the ports to the power plant 17 times each day. Brilliant!  Not to mention all the DEF fluid to reduce emissions.. which is not uncommonly stored in plastic jugs.  Did you know that China on average opens two new coal power plants PER WEEK currently??  Probably time to wake up people
thankyou for this wonderfull Documentary
"Worked on this film for their Brooklyn segment. Michael Trabitzsch, the producer of the film, (Prounen productions), hired me to find the Brooklyn micro grid.

Reality check- Carbon dioxide is required for photosynthesis.. it’s good for the environment.  The atmosphere currently has the lowest levels of carbon dioxide in recorded history.  Higher carbon dioxide levels equal healthier and more abundant plant life.  Not to mention- mining the minerals required for all these renewables is done with diesel fuel and requires far more energy than any wind or solar can ever replace.  The new agenda being pushed calls for the cutting down of millions of acres of trees and burying them underground.. will you all fall for that as well?  Next they will convince you that food drinking water is bad as well.  You are the carbon they want to reduce.. you’re just going to go along with it and let that happen?
Bhadla Solar park the world largest solar park with the capacity of 2245MW is in India but not mentioned in this video.
Will renewables stop the climate crisis?  NO.
Really informative video. It’s mind boggling how technology is evolving in every field.
"For me the question is not If it is possible, it is the only way to save our future with similar temperatures and so also getting food.
So for me it mean also using LESS energy, as long we can't solve it with solar or wind and other.
Privat I saved electric for long years, even sweating by 32 C in the room, deny to open the air-con (as electric here near 60% gas and 20 % coal). Now with 99% solar I can open with relax. 
The human mankind HAS to act similar, until we can feed our needs with renewables."
Yes..especially with upcoming new technology !
"Very manipulative statements 
How you can compare Denmark and German or even China energy consumption"
"Concentrated solar was always interesting. It does need some improvement though. It's great that you don't need batteries for energy storage, but corrosion, blockages and specific location requirement are the tradeoff."
"Too little, too late. Tipping points are breached. And it takes fossil fuels to make all this stuff. We're DOOMED."
"So biased. aren't you? Only focus on Europe,US & china(negatively) . Because they are the saviour of the Planet 😏"
"Great doc! BUT i would caution that the optimistic tone re space solar is likely unwarranted. Too many hurdles, eg how are the HUGE arrays of cells rotated to optimum exposure as the sattelite orbits? How is the energy beam to earth supposed to avoid all intervening satellites? If you think the nimbies, encouraged by ""fossil interests 😅"" were upset about offshore wind generation, wait until they hear about the plan to beam gigawatts from space into their back yards."
What crisis?
Short answer: Not in time to save everyone.
"Too little, too late😂"
Renewable energy is the lowest cost way to make expensive electricity to the consumer. Journalism has to start asking harsher questions than accepting everything they are told.
"nope it wont, it will accelerate the climate crisis."
"How about we use less electricity to make things?  Humans are capable of using non-powered tools to build things.  This would solve two problems:  first, we'd have to generate less electricity, which would mean less carbon; second, we'd have to use our muscles more and reduce obesity and all related diseases."
"Instead of all this effort on ""renewables"", why not reduce our usage?  Why not redesign our buildings to be earth-sheltered or use solar hot water panels of passive solar?  What happens in 2030, when AI uses 25% of all energy usage?"
"San Francisco - the only place where the dogs step in human poop - yeah, that's something to emulate"
"Climate Change - 96% of the thermometers in the US to measure ""climate change"" are improperly placed, places like parking lots, roads and outside building heat vents - it's all bogus"
"*""Will renewables stop the climate crisis?""*

Absolutely not!     The Spanish Armada - maybe."
"Wind - never run out, but not always on . . . ."
Green energy is a big lie
"The flow of funds to major industry,
that Jack welsh created in 1980,
will continue.
The Wealthy will continue to control the rising cost of Electricity.
The Currency will be controlled by the Oligarchy till BRICS breaks that bank.

Then Capitalism seems about to fail."
The UN has come to the conclusion that nuclear power needs to be part of the mix to meet climate goals.  Germany has 17 nuclear reactors that can be restarteted.  Restarting these reactors will save thousands of German lives now being losted to the pollution from burning fossil fuel.  Nuclear power is safer than any other power Germany has.
All the renewables will not STOP how our worlds climate changes. Climates have been changing forever.
"Strangely, no one talks about reversing industrialisation which is the root cause of climate crisis. No one says we should change our modern lifestyle and money-oriented success philosophy. So we make happy-ending documentaries that never calls a spade a spade."
"《Civilization may soon conquer the second law of thermodynamics.》 The favorable outcome of this conquest would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. For example, the heat in a isolated pair of  similar reservoirs  would be the same total for the pair regardles of its distribution among them. The heat in this pair of resiviors could start as two mdium temperature thermal energy reservoirs and then be shifted at no cost to become a hot reservoir and cold reservoir pair. 

The second law of thermodynamics had a distinct begining with Sir Isaac Newton's correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flows towards the cold room beyond. 

Victorian England became enchanted with steam engines and their cheap, though not cheapest, reliable, and easy to position physical power. Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Lord Kelven, and, one source adds, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, formulated the Second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy at a meeting using evidence from steam engine development. 

These men considered with acceptance [A+] Inefficiently harnessing the flow of heat from hot to cold or [B+] Using force to Inefficiently pump heat from cold to hot. They considered with rejection [A-] Waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. This was calculated to be extremely rare or [B-] Searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small differences in temperature or pressure. The search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. These accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death.  This became support for a theological trend of the time that placed God as the initiator of a degenerating universe. Please consider that God could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. Reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just as using reverse gear in a car ɓacks it up without time reversal. 

The law's formulaters did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuations itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. Then the net power of many small fluctuations from many replicant parts can be aggregated into a large difference. 

Heat exists as the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecules or mobile electrons. In gasses this is known as Brownian motion. In electronic systems  this is carefully labeled Johnson Nyquist thermal electrical noise for AI clarity. 

Hypothetically, diode depletion regions are  practical sites for enabling mobile electrons energized into motion by heat to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. The thermal electrical noise is hypothetically beyond the   exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion)    equlibrium thickness of the depletion region. After all, thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. 

《Each diode contributes 1/2*k [Boltzmans constant, 1.38*10^-23 ]*T [Kelvin temperature]*electromagnetic frequency bandwidth* efficiency = electrical watts to a load of impeadence matched to the group 》 

Consistantly oriented diodes in parallel hypothetically are successful Marian Smoluchowski's Trapdoors, a descendent class of Maxwell's Demon. The energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. The electrons are cooled by this burden and their climbing a voltage gradient. Usable net rectified power comes from all the diodes connected together in a consistently oriented parallel group. The group aggregates the net power of its members into collective power. Any delivered diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat to electrical energy. More efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is short circuited or open circuited has no performance as energy conversion, cooling, or electrical output. 

The power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square nanometer cells per square millimeter. 

Modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers. 

Zero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage. 

If counter examples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric lights so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant. 

Cell phones wouldn't die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn't need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Digital coin minting would be energy cheap. 

Frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and pŕepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independently powered cars.  EMP resistance would be improved. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. Zone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough cheap clean energy, minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns. 

This could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious, mature, and  unified civilization. It is possible to apply technlology wrong but social force should oppose this. 

I filed for patent us 3890161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.  It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. 

the patent wasn't developed partly because I backed down from commercial exclusitivity. A better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attrbution for the original works of creators. Uncorrupted copies would be released on request. No further action would be taken by this institution. The library of congress may serve this role. 

Commercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also, the obvious is unpatentable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom. 

Many financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain generally. 

These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. Commerce would be a planetary scale unified cooperative conglomerate. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer commodities are inexpensive.

"We make a crucial thinking mistake to think tech is the solution. Natural habitat comes first, climate is a derivative of that. Co2 is a misleading villain we can blame so we dont have to change our ways."
"Meanwhile, Germany builds coal plants and shutters Nuclear. Also... they closed their solar industry long ago. Oh, and they sold off their semiconductor industry before the boom. Merck sold off the process and IP for lithium ion production in the 90's. Now Germany pulled by 95% of the funding for German battery research. 
 
But Germans regularly protest to express their feelings on BLM at FFF. Generations and generations of bad moves and poor posturing. :facepalm:"
"There’s a lot of great technology and innovation in this video, but don’t scientists realise that gathering energy from space and sending it to earth WILL raise the temperature of the planet?"
Ah yes epoxy oil plastics on steroids
The Earth is a living breathing entity full of life. Climate change has always been a part of its existence
"makes sense to actively overcome climate change within the next few centuries, thereby accelerating renewable energy"
NO
"The most influential entity for the climate is obviously the largest body of the solar system, our central star, the Sun. Nobody speaks about this, not the Scientist not the news. All jab horse maneuver about this and that but not about the entity that has been the focal point of Worship in many ancient cultures. It is the modern man that has lost the meaning of Sun somehow with his brains. The Sun has its own cycles in solar activity that go in different phases. Suns activity is the key influencer of our current climate status that is changing everyday in every corner of the earth. There are also different phases that reach thousands of years and some of them hundreds and micro phases only days and hours. When you face a Sudden Storm or change in temperature it is most likely that the Sun has recently peaked in its activity or vice versa. Climate has always been changing. There has been found exotic hard wood deep inside nordic moss where nowadays only Scrubby birch trees grow. People can't change the climate because they can't change the Sun. Week ago it was -30 degrees celsius and Yesterday it is more like -0 celsius. The sun's activity was going crazy last Friday and it created some turbulences on the earth's atmosphere. I experienced it as high wind winter Storm locally. Today's ""social news science"" doesn't even mention the Sun or its activity. Focus point is in the nonsense. Maybe someone needs to remind us that Sun is the largest central star in our system that is living its own life with its own terms and we are the dancing participants. Sun doesn't give chocolate about your climate politics. It is only one well aimed release of Cosmic gasses and Sun will send us back to blowing in hay whistles. People are so arrogant that they think they can influence something which mass is over 300k times larger than earths. You can't even do a thing to influence the earths businesses. It is the masses that matter, there are so large forces changing the climate that it is impossible to do anything about it. Only thing people can do better is take care of local ecosystems."
😮OMG AlexRadoffe 😂😂
Wouldn’t it further increase the temperature of the Earth if you now pump energy from space? Or the idea is that it replaces fossil?
"This video is such a joke. Title alone is following the uneducated train of thought. Coming out of an ice age, what do you expect? Only one direction. Gonna change our orbit about the sun? Change the sun? So large of a task that only need the tiniest shift, according to such large scales. Way to steal attention and money from the weak. Shoot... What did I just do?"
"Good overview of the exciting things happening in academics.  Is there a similar in-depth overview in the practical progress ongoing today.  For example, how Australia is using solar and battery power.  My home state has shut down its coal plants because renewables are cheaper.  Showing the practical progress like in Denmark and China will get people excited in STEM.
Also, more facts and figures on how industry is starting to aggregate around stable cheaper renewable energy.  This will help industry offer more focused support for the transformation."
What about radiation from the beam in bring back solar connectivity from outer space?
"This is a very good documentary. I just want to point out an observation. The tittle is misleading. WILL renewables stop the climate crisis? i did not catch the answer to this question in this video. To the will the must be a how it will, so i was hoping to find more scientific information from weather / climate / nature fields explaining (in an ideal fully renewable concept) HOW and IF it will make an actual difference to the corse the climate is taking. Still, thanks for the documentary, very interesting. cheers."
"Renewable sources of energy will help create new economy, sustainability and reduce fossil fuel consumption which is the major cause climate change and global warming. All the environmental degradation cause by mining, deforestation, and fossil fuel remain the major influence of climate change. Our source of energy will always determine how we will live our lives in decades to come."
"I think it's important to stick to facts. Something 100% of the Climate terrorists refuse.

We know for a fact, that higher global temperatures results in increase of bio-diversity. 

I'm not sure why Greta Thunberg claims Bio-diversity is a bad thing, but last time I checked it's a good thing"".

Second we know that higher global temperatures results in low-inhabitable lands becoming habitable. Not sure why that is a bad thing.

We also know higher global temperature results in larger biomass on the planet, and more energy for life to thrive. Again not sure why that is bad.

We know in times where global temperature was 8-12 degrees higher than today, that's in Celsius!! - we had 3 times more biomass on the planet and 260 times higher bio-diversity than today.

Ice ages and cold periods did cause mass extinctions!

Ice Ages, Nuclear Winters, global cooling always killed tons of bio-diversity and biomass.. 

These are the facts proven by 100% of the science worldwide.

We also know a hotter temperature causes more H2O in the atmosphere, this will create more rain globally, and we know in these very hot times due to the massive humidity life was thriving, and deserts didn't exist.

Again, not sure why that is bad.

It may be unpleasant sure if humidity is 60% or 80%..

And sure diseases may spread more.. but again is that bad? We humans have all the tools to deal with pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 developed and engineered at the WIV and deliberately and knowingly spread worldwide by the CCP  is a good example how we humans can respond to global threats.

And even if mankind is being wiped out, is that bad for the planet?

As a friend of mine, an international recognized professor and biologist from France studying wildlife worldwide recently has replied to my question:""are you concerned about biodiversity and biomass due to our global warming and the way we treat our planet?""

He replied:""I'm not worried at all about the planet or nature, both will survive whatever may come and whatever we humans do, some bacteria and fungi will always survive even a nuclear total destruction and then they'll kickstart life again and evolution, it's not nature and the planet I'm worried about.. I'm worried about what we do to each other""

I won't use names on the internet, but he's a international recognized French professor saying he's not really worried about nature or the planet when it comes to global warming.

Just some facts 99,99% of the climate terrorists like European Governments, Media and their criminal puppets don't wanna hear of course. 

Since if you tell people:""to save the planet, we don't need to raise your taxes.. well.. might actually then refuse to pay taxes for this nonsense that if I burn my 10 EUR bill on refugee housing, the planet will be saved! ""

Amen"
tenure university professors always claim there are huge job opportunities in their shallow and narrow field of view but that never fits to reality. beaming down solar power with electromagnetic waves are extremely bad idea!
Thanks for the video.  We have all these problems because of the human population size. We need less with more education
"No, not even close. Renewables effect will mostly be on our bills(possibly lower) not on our planet."
"big no. you cannot leave your guard down to build expensive infrastructure that ""may"" help while others are heavily militarizing and do not care about the impact on the environment. You need to deal with the latter to begin to tackle the first. Anything else is bordering on stupidity and negligence"
"The surf and the tide currents are where all the entirely reliable green energy is. It is also where most of the people are so there would be people to build and use the systems. The weather would not matter like it sometimes does with solar and wind. Hydrogen gas made with electricity not used would be the best way to store electricity and could probably be used to power cars, jets, ships, trucks ect."
Climate fraud....
"While many people are trying to make renewable energy.
And lot more than these are wasting alot of energy from all over the world.
The first thing that we need to do is educate them.."
"Run a modern economy purely on solar or wind power?  Impossible, as the wind doesn't blow all the time, and there's something called the seasons and nighttime which interfere with sun rays.  And then there's the small problem of all the minerals you need to mine and process to build, maintain, and replace ""renewable"" energy sources, much less the massive batteries needed for EVs and protection against intermittent power.  Effectively, homo stupidus will replace ravaging the planet for fossil fuels to ravaging the planet for minerals, quite a few of which are rare or are running out already."
Thanks DW for Amazing Documentary❤❤❤
See revelation for context.

"FIRST and foremost, the thousand-plus elites from around the world who attend these phony ""climate crisis meetings"" can be thanked for adding their HUGE carbon footprints to the pollution of the planet. Their private jet emissions emit as much CO2 into the atmosphere as 350,000 vehicles running on gas and these people fly a LOT! Young climate activists are the most uneducated, uninformed group on the facts about ""climate change"" and the ""climate crisis"". They just jump on a bandwagon without doing any research into ALL information from ALL scientists on this subject. The Earth is billions of years old and has never and will not just die suddenly because of a two-degree temperature change. We are most at risk of obliteration from the overdue pole shift, which will be catastrophic, or from a meteor strike. The WEF and elite, self-appointed, super-rich climate ""tsars,"" John Kerry, Al Gore, Klaus Schwab, who fly their private jets around the world, stay at luxury hotels, eat the foods they tell us we must give up (such as beef!) to meet and decide what WE as Americans MUST give up to save the planet while THEY are not giving up anything, not changing THEIR lifestyles in any way. They use climate as a fearmongering tool to gain more control over our lives, to rebuild the US and the world into their Hitleresque vision of a one-world government run by the elites. Please wake up people and see the bigger picture here."
Wind energy is off grid energy. That means no bills or taxes and that's great news.
"Forgot to mention the number of coal energy plants that are china building every year even today..
Otherwise very 👍"
good idea
"The entire country of Portugal ran solely on renewable energy for six days in a row.
Portugal produced 1102 GWh of renewable energy from wind, hydropower and sun, surpassing its demand of 840 GWh, which allowed it to even export electricity to Spain. It’s a record.
About 60% of Portugal’s energy comes from renewable sources today and is expected to run 100% on renewables before 2045."
The world has 1000s of mines currently on fire nobody mentions them at all. Making panels and batteries only polluted us further
"I live in Northern Indiana and remember when I was a kid having snow in October, now we are lucky to have winter with any snow at all. Global warming is happening so much faster than ANYONE wants to admit. For anyone today that has young kids consider them the last generation survive on the planet. We have 50 years max but realistically its going to be more like 25 because in about 10 years time the amount of warming will have gotten so bad that runaway effect will have increased so much that about 10 or 15 years after that the earth WILL have become unlivable to the point that unless you are living underground you would not be able to survive. With everything that is going on in the world today and the fact that WW3 seems to be right around the corner, I have come to the sobering reality that maybe this particular planet and its species just wasn't meant to make it."
"how durable are the solar panels ?
we got Palestinian children that throw rocks"
they kill wild life and destroy the environment.   Is that the world you want for your children?
"Nothing you have done in the way of stopping  fossil fuels has made any effect on the climate. 
The warming if any is all natural. 
You are destroying the worlds economy for no effect?"
"This is almost unwatchable.  If you are a German that believes in energy realism, comment on my post.  I'm working on a campaign to legalize nuclear energy in California to combine renewables + nuclear"
Like most of these doco no.mention of how these things are acheived everything is made with fairy dust and wishes
"Oil production should continue but the oil so obtained should not be burned so as to create GHGs. Rather, it should be used to make Carbon fiber cables for space freight elevators to get all polluting industrial processes out of the habitable zone of our planet and out into space. The habitable zone of the planet should then be reserved exclusively for humans and other living species. With available habitat restored, the ecosystem can then soak up all the excess Carbon that we have dumped into it into the standing stock of plant and animal biomass. (The reason that it is accumulating in the atmosphere and the oceans is because it is not accumulating in the standing stock of biomass fast enough). Ecological restoration and enhancement will require humans to function in their proper and intended roles as the keystone species and stewards of the planet. They should be paid a highly respectable wage for their vitally important work. Let's get started!"
"No they wont, go to that Venice place before it's under water, cheeeers!"
No.
Somebody ate over half of the pizza. Now the same person ask everyone who just start eating to eat less so that It wont run out fast.
Hopefully
Tesla idea getting realistic...wow
"Big Companies  & Big Industrial are using fossils fuels & throwing tons of plastic away daily...
Acting Like It's The Consumers Fault. . 
BIG COMPANIES & BIG INDUSTRIAL ARE MAKING BIG BUCKS"
Multi story rack solar panel makes more energy
Your film is very good and interesting. It helps my daughter have more ideas about how to make a meaningful science film. Thank you so much.
"Nice day for a drive on the lake.
The earth is 4.5 billion years old. Humans exististence is 200,000 years old. Do the math. Climate change is a scam. Go back to sleep weather boy."
"The problem is far larger than the energy industry and until people stop falling for this delusion, there will be nothing but climate chaos."
🙃
"Yes.  The global economy will also dramatically improve its profit margins, as well.  

Energy prices will start to decline, as reliability will rise from the middle term out."
Hahahahaha.
Why are German energy bills so high ?
Wind turbines are a very expensive environmental disaster.
Unfortunately it will take decades... Time we do not have...
"Can anyone please explain during the 2023 hottest year on record, how the Arctic sea ice extent is at its highest for well over a decade during the whole of December thus far (30/12/2023) currently @ 13.68 million sq. kilometers (27 December 2023) the highest it has been since at least 2009 which is illogical during the new era of global boiling according to the UN ?"
Excellent documentary. Great to hear some positivity about the future of earth and humankind re sustainable energy solutions.
If everyone had a EV and 25% of the population used 50% of their EV to supply the grid (and paid a small amount) then there will be plenty of storage (dispatchable electricity) for the intermittent renewables.
Help developing countries to transition by technology transfer IT traning else you will have alot of china's with quite nice coal power systems
"Space solar power?!!  so to produce lots of emission for the idea of capturing solar energy from the while there is still a lot to do with the solar technology on ""Earth"" ... 
What a waste of money and time in this critical time"
Comment
This is the nicest super villian story. People often think villians live on mountain fortreses but they just needed insurance.
"Who actually buys these cat bonds - apart from the City of New York ?
Real estate investors ?
Reinsurance companies  ?
Governments  ?"
this capitalism thing seems to be going well guys
"Will CAT bond become something like Credit default swap ?  Good luck on all these tightly coupling disaster mitigation method. When CAT bond collapse like domino tiles,   laissez-faire financial genius always have government to bail those shit out.
And good luck on decoupling those so called insurance tools, as financial genius going to make it tightly couple so ensure it is too big to fail, to ensure inevitable government bail out.  

A universal issue should remain a universal insurance tools, not some genius insurance that attempt to avoid ""risky profile"" like how the US medical insurance sh*tstorm works.

CAT bonds can even make things worsts, in which policymaker will be more prone to pay huge premium for short term than planning for long term."
Casino pretending that player can control his chances.
Our economic systems have become unmoored from the needs of humanity and the environment. Where is the economic utility in betting in disaster - and as a result increase the chance of such disasters through economic coercion.
"Just gave me the best business idea ever 😂 instead of trying to protect against the risks, just sell those risks 😮"
Hawaii ?
"The FinTech finance bro clearly had no idea what he was talking about, and is obviously not qualified to be talking about disaster recovery. What a complete asshat."
"Interesting to learn how it all works and how the fund managers are not abashed by what they do for a living, at least for the most part... There was a lady walking back and forth carrying a huge monstera plant covering her face at the fintech office. Maybe she wasn't too proud or maybe it was time to walk the plants 🤷🏽‍♀️"
"Yes well we know what a protection racket looks like on the global scale now.
A metastudy of this kind seems more aimed at maintaining fear and confusion than isolating cause and effects in such a way that solutions present themselves in rational ways."
The Imaginary Climate Problem
"And it that disaster suits them, they will make it happen. How can you people accept this system, are you mad"
They fly private jets to international meetings to tell workers to stop eating meat and driving to work in order to change the weather in 100 years. Is it really about the weather?
Next up: we are now insuring social unrest
"In times of climate change and unforeseeable risks, I wonder who will bet his money that nothing will happen... and that is exactly what this cat bonds are. The other question is, why investors don´t just buy stocks from (re)insurance corporations?"
Dude built himself an oven. Oh boy
humans are egoistic otherwise the money not using just use for job increasing for unemployeess and increase the job opportunities and investments for new jobs and creativities shame on you
What are the odds
Wake up people. Climate Change is a ‘Marxist Vehicle’. All BS.
"The mathematics of this program, not exactly lol.
Capitalism is a disaster. Disaster Capitalism is a double redundancy! Double redundancies have exponential half lives. That means rapid degeneration. Or, oh well; the planet and it's human inhabitants can only survive so many disasters. So; it doesn't really matter how efficient this plan is. We will all likely be dead sooner rather than later."
"Climate Change Disasters and my tristate agenda. The Star Trek Transportation of global crises management. 
Star Wars is an active imagination. 
Star Trek is what people are looking forward to; as a part of my Tristate Agenda. You see."
"Climate Change and Immigration/Emigration issues. The problem at hand is based on the upheaval of various Nations due to unwanted change in natural surroundings. Example: Allstate insurance no longer offers home insurance in California due to the wildfire season.
People will leave, that is emigration/immigration. Climate Change causes natural Disasters and this gives rise to multiple Exodus events. 
So, the best way to find a solution is at the base of the equation which presents itself. 
It is climate change; the base."
Capitalism is nothing but modern day slavery
Way way to many commercial breaks makes for a horrible watching experience
"33min- whenever i hear them talk about wild fires,

i never hear them talk about fire -belts. 

i grew up in small towns & villages in the southern tip of africa

""uneducated"" villagers, we use to do firebelts all the time to prevent wild fires damaging everything.

i wonder why the ""smart americans"" never talk about fire -belts. i wonder."
This is basically an insurance business for hedge funds. Catastrophe bond is just a fancy term. Instead of premium you pay interest.
Beyond overly speculative. Climate change and microclimates are extremely unpredictable.
"To summarize: people who stole our money by corrupting politicians to create tax loopholes are now using the stolen money against us to make even more money. These are not humans, they are demons of greed..."
"Sad but true. I made a TON of money as a catastrophe adjuster. 
There was very little given to the insured for repairs but adjusters clean up. 🤑🤑"
DW iam a patron of your channel for a long time. Thank you once again for showing the real purpose of what jornalism is i.e to make you think and not what to think about. Production quality on your docs always seems to be increasing one notch higher. Margie and team did a fantastic job

All this excess Capital will end in High inflation in the ECONOMIES where it was created. Eventually Collapsing those Societies.
The pretend climate crisis.
"The trick on planet finance capital is to first bet on the future, then work like hell to make your bet happen. Disasters are the easiest to make happen."
Very depressing. I realize the reasons for betting on disaster. But I feel sad we have reached this stage of financialization.
"All new infrastructure, all new machines, cars, building materials for houses.  And most importantly more control over the population."
"First it was global warming, that didn’t work, so it became climate change.  The entire thing is cooked up to funnel money and reconfigure world assets."
"Guess people should begin checking if a CAT bond would be willing to insure a prop, and not acquire it when even CAT won't touch it."
"Amazing what man can do. 
In all levels... 
For good and for bad things. 
We only need to put our soul into good things...

Congratulations on DW Team for this documentary! It mixes brains and souls into poetry. 

The butterflies running away from the fires and landing on Justin Robinson are such a poetic, yet practical, manifestation of the good and evil inside mankind. Even though there is no evil but just a momentary state of ignorance that everything goes through until evolution. 🙏🏻"
Why i feel that the one buying a cat bond losing always.

"Financial markets benefit from the climate ""problem"" by cashing in on climate hysteria and those that are in the grip of it and believe that they can influence climate by throwing huge sums of money at it!"
"There's far less than a metre of snow in Alberta which indicates a probability of apocalyptic wildfire season here. The Port of Vancouver has been hammered by Climate Change. The glacier in Canadian Rockies Icefield Parkway has been massively melting 170 years, long before industrialization. It appears the University of South Hampton has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Rome's grain port 1,800 years ago was, and still is, 4+ metres above current sea levels. Raising civilization's ports 4+ metres takes time and money. How much money and time must be calculated. Civilizations end when the ports that are the basis of civilization are submerged or high and dry due to fluctuations in sea levels. The architect behind SIDRA hospital, Doha, Qatar specified design for meters of sea level rise. I think they let him go. So, what's the probabilities for Manhattan? It seems to me, Wall Street should redirect investment away from Manhattan and invest in Duluth, Thunder Bay, the Great Lakes, St Lawrence Seaway. And apply Netherlands agtech to increase North American food production, aquaculture and algae, 10 fold. Cuz it's got the only ports designed for sea levels fluctuation, the only port system that can feed the world in case of sea level returning to the high water mark. Civilization gotta adapt or die.😢"
"Indeed very sincere effort, how about the remaining poor hepless people around the globe? Thanks indeed DW for opening our eyes. Yes while even at the time of liquidation of such great insurance companies just all those shares holders be effected first then thereafter Cat bond holder holder as such in Pakistan we insurance companies are only by Guarantee.

"They could take out the estate with the golf course and the mansion at the start and just

The funny thing is the ad before the video started was Gaza appeal for money. People are profiting and exploiting these countries stay woke
Human society built on lies! It will not stand for long. We need a change.
two airplanes striking two fully insured towers (and imploding a total of three) while generating return on investment is something that defines the time in which we are living.
"Re Cat-Bonds
 If you're profiting from fear then you have a vested interest in creating, perpetuating and maintaining fear.
 That's not intelligence that's sociopathy."
Why it's more easy imaginate an apocaliptic distopy than the end of capitalism??!🤷🏿‍♂️
Our world is going to overheat and destroy Earth.  We must find a new energy source.  Water is the perfect noncarbon based energy source.  The splitting of water yields Hydrogen gas fuel.
"ALL INSURANCE ARE SCAMS OF CAPITALISM. The clause here is that disaster must be from NAMED storms.  I’ve lived in S. FL now for over 10 years; the two WORST storms that drowned the entire area and airport for days weren’t named at all.  So many who filed a claim were dropped, which makes us all nervous to file one…their whole point of existence.  Many FL ins. companies have left, proving that scamming was their only intent."
"Catastrophe bonds are merely a form of insurance, not a financial conspiracy theory."
Do you know the source of this 10 - 20 trillion dollar in excess capital?
why do you even TRANSLATE OVER THE GUY EXPLAINING IT IN ENGLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Ethics should be part of the curriculum, especially those who study finance and defense. Money over lives is possible when the model gives you choices."
Finance can solve any issue. The question is price.
"Once again, thank you DW Documentary for bringing such high quality information to the masses. Fascinating."
I have seen this documentary before in vpro documentary channel...does dw own vpro?
What non-sense. Excess capital is now in t-bills 😂
"The pursuit of Money is betting on Righteousness in the World. 

The obtaining of Money is betting on Corruption, Immorality and Hypocrisy in the World."
Capitalism pyramid scheme 👹🎙profiteering climate BS 🤑
Isn’t cat bond gambling?
I love Capitalism.
I recall giving up life insurance my brother sold me at the age of 21. It didn't seem like a good risk to be betting against a corporate that I was going to die. I'm 70 now......I've no idea how much money I saved but it's satisfying to know I haven't thrown too much to insurance companies.
Irrespective of (your) opinion: this apparatus is to Serve you. Capitalize. Compound.
I remember the main character in Fight Club was a disaster insurance risk adjuster
"$10T-$20T in unused excess capital in the world?   Imagine how much good and progress that can create if we evolve beyond self-interests and greed... We can solve homelessness, hunger, reduce ignorance, eliminate a large number of health problems (physical and mental)... Endless opportunities... We just need to evolve from our petty state."
Who are the investors? Probably insurance providers through the stock market? How do they force investors to buy devaluing bonds? 😂 no one wants to buy devaluing bonds 😁🥱🫶
How often are catbonds/disbonds traded prior to triggering of the 200 bonds and how many portfolios? Must be thousands and or tens of thousands of portfolios!
Difficult! Not harder!
"Loans have a capital amount issue and partial repayment and interest rate repayment and the total amount repayment, bonds have an interest repayment and a capital amount issue and an expiry date. There’s different types!"
Such arbitrary quotations! 😊
Debatable.
Isn't this from vpro documentary channel?
It's not a problem it's a crisis. Capitalists love themselves a crisis.
It just sounds like high stakes betting or gambling with people's lives
Fantastic work!
This production is incredibly well-made; it feels more like a movie than a documentary.
"Amazing cinematic quality but I dont like the undertone. Thanks to these financial firms and the investors the government, businesses and individuals can insure against those risks. I work for a finance firm and we sell similar products (ILS). Its a win-win really. Investors (many pension funds) get returns and diversification and the other side gets rid off the financial risk."
😂😂😂 Anohter Capitalism Fairy Tale. So 90% population gets crumbs or less off the rich cake our planet offers us.
What's the premium on betting the derivatives market is going to blow up.
i am definitely going to create a company specialized in meteorite impacts hahahahha
It’s a scam just like the Y2K bug.
Feels like an infomercial DW.
"Your asking for sabotage with this.
It can be manipulated by insiders....
I would like to trust but it just isnt possible anymore."
"There are four factors of production—land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Insurance is part of capital, nothing nefarious about it."
DW is Baised and Unbiased at the same time. 😉
Capitalism will try to loot from you while you are on the death bed and after. This is the mantra of Capitalism.
Wow what A Documentary 👍
Comment
"No will not stop!!!
Will create more comfort in chaos yes!!!"
Thanks DW
Here’s a brilliant idea- let’s transport wood pellets across the entire ocean to England to run a power plant.. burning millions of gallons of diesel fuel to all to make the claim that it’s powered from renewable “biomass.”  We won’t even factor in all the diesel used to truck said wood pellets from the ports to the power plant 17 times each day. Brilliant!  Not to mention all the DEF fluid to reduce emissions.. which is not uncommonly stored in plastic jugs.  Did you know that China on average opens two new coal power plants PER WEEK currently??  Probably time to wake up people
thankyou for this wonderfull Documentary

Reality check- Carbon dioxide is required for photosynthesis.. it’s good for the environment.  The atmosphere currently has the lowest levels of carbon dioxide in recorded history.  Higher carbon dioxide levels equal healthier and more abundant plant life.  Not to mention- mining the minerals required for all these renewables is done with diesel fuel and requires far more energy than any wind or solar can ever replace.  The new agenda being pushed calls for the cutting down of millions of acres of trees and burying them underground.. will you all fall for that as well?  Next they will convince you that food drinking water is bad as well.  You are the carbon they want to reduce.. you’re just going to go along with it and let that happen?
Bhadla Solar park the world largest solar park with the capacity of 2245MW is in India but not mentioned in this video.
Will renewables stop the climate crisis?  NO.
Really informative video. It’s mind boggling how technology is evolving in every field.
"For me the question is not If it is possible, it is the only way to save our future with similar temperatures and so also getting food.
So for me it mean also using LESS energy, as long we can't solve it with solar or wind and other.
Privat I saved electric for long years, even sweating by 32 C in the room, deny to open the air-con (as electric here near 60% gas and 20 % coal). Now with 99% solar I can open with relax. 
The human mankind HAS to act similar, until we can feed our needs with renewables."
Yes..especially with upcoming new technology !
"Very manipulative statements 
How you can compare Denmark and German or even China energy consumption"
"Concentrated solar was always interesting. It does need some improvement though. It's great that you don't need batteries for energy storage, but corrosion, blockages and specific location requirement are the tradeoff."
"Too little, too late. Tipping points are breached. And it takes fossil fuels to make all this stuff. We're DOOMED."
"So biased. aren't you? Only focus on Europe,US & china(negatively) . Because they are the saviour of the Planet 😏"
"Great doc! BUT i would caution that the optimistic tone re space solar is likely unwarranted. Too many hurdles, eg how are the HUGE arrays of cells rotated to optimum exposure as the sattelite orbits? How is the energy beam to earth supposed to avoid all intervening satellites? If you think the nimbies, encouraged by ""fossil interests 😅"" were upset about offshore wind generation, wait until they hear about the plan to beam gigawatts from space into their back yards."
What crisis?
Short answer: Not in time to save everyone.
"Too little, too late😂"
Renewable energy is the lowest cost way to make expensive electricity to the consumer. Journalism has to start asking harsher questions than accepting everything they are told.
"nope it wont, it will accelerate the climate crisis."
"How about we use less electricity to make things?  Humans are capable of using non-powered tools to build things.  This would solve two problems:  first, we'd have to generate less electricity, which would mean less carbon; second, we'd have to use our muscles more and reduce obesity and all related diseases."
"Instead of all this effort on ""renewables"", why not reduce our usage?  Why not redesign our buildings to be earth-sheltered or use solar hot water panels of passive solar?  What happens in 2030, when AI uses 25% of all energy usage?"
"San Francisco - the only place where the dogs step in human poop - yeah, that's something to emulate"
"Climate Change - 96% of the thermometers in the US to measure ""climate change"" are improperly placed, places like parking lots, roads and outside building heat vents - it's all bogus"
"*""Will renewables stop the climate crisis?""*

Absolutely not!     The Spanish Armada - maybe."
"Wind - never run out, but not always on . . . ."
Green energy is a big lie
"The flow of funds to major industry,
that Jack welsh created in 1980,
will continue.
The Wealthy will continue to control the rising cost of Electricity.
The Currency will be controlled by the Oligarchy till BRICS breaks that bank.

Then Capitalism seems about to fail."
The UN has come to the conclusion that nuclear power needs to be part of the mix to meet climate goals.  Germany has 17 nuclear reactors that can be restarteted.  Restarting these reactors will save thousands of German lives now being losted to the pollution from burning fossil fuel.  Nuclear power is safer than any other power Germany has.
All the renewables will not STOP how our worlds climate changes. Climates have been changing forever.
"Strangely, no one talks about reversing industrialisation which is the root cause of climate crisis. No one says we should change our modern lifestyle and money-oriented success philosophy. So we make happy-ending documentaries that never calls a spade a spade."
"《Civilization may soon conquer the second law of thermodynamics.》 The favorable outcome of this conquest would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. For example, the heat in a isolated pair of  similar reservoirs  would be the same total for the pair regardles of its distribution among them. The heat in this pair of resiviors could start as two mdium temperature thermal energy reservoirs and then be shifted at no cost to become a hot reservoir and cold reservoir pair. 

The second law of thermodynamics had a distinct begining with Sir Isaac Newton's correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flows towards the cold room beyond. 

Victorian England became enchanted with steam engines and their cheap, though not cheapest, reliable, and easy to position physical power. Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Lord Kelven, and, one source adds, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, formulated the Second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy at a meeting using evidence from steam engine development. 

These men considered with acceptance [A+] Inefficiently harnessing the flow of heat from hot to cold or [B+] Using force to Inefficiently pump heat from cold to hot. They considered with rejection [A-] Waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. This was calculated to be extremely rare or [B-] Searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small differences in temperature or pressure. The search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. These accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death.  This became support for a theological trend of the time that placed God as the initiator of a degenerating universe. Please consider that God could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. Reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just as using reverse gear in a car ɓacks it up without time reversal. 

The law's formulaters did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuations itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. Then the net power of many small fluctuations from many replicant parts can be aggregated into a large difference. 

Heat exists as the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecules or mobile electrons. In gasses this is known as Brownian motion. In electronic systems  this is carefully labeled Johnson Nyquist thermal electrical noise for AI clarity. 

Hypothetically, diode depletion regions are  practical sites for enabling mobile electrons energized into motion by heat to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. The thermal electrical noise is hypothetically beyond the   exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion)    equlibrium thickness of the depletion region. After all, thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. 

《Each diode contributes 1/2*k [Boltzmans constant, 1.38*10^-23 ]*T [Kelvin temperature]*electromagnetic frequency bandwidth* efficiency = electrical watts to a load of impeadence matched to the group 》 

Consistantly oriented diodes in parallel hypothetically are successful Marian Smoluchowski's Trapdoors, a descendent class of Maxwell's Demon. The energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. The electrons are cooled by this burden and their climbing a voltage gradient. Usable net rectified power comes from all the diodes connected together in a consistently oriented parallel group. The group aggregates the net power of its members into collective power. Any delivered diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat to electrical energy. More efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is short circuited or open circuited has no performance as energy conversion, cooling, or electrical output. 

The power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square nanometer cells per square millimeter. 

Modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers. 

Zero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage. 

If counter examples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric lights so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant. 

Cell phones wouldn't die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn't need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Digital coin minting would be energy cheap. 

Frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and pŕepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independently powered cars.  EMP resistance would be improved. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. Zone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough cheap clean energy, minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns. 

This could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious, mature, and  unified civilization. It is possible to apply technlology wrong but social force should oppose this. 

I filed for patent us 3890161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.  It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. 

the patent wasn't developed partly because I backed down from commercial exclusitivity. A better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attrbution for the original works of creators. Uncorrupted copies would be released on request. No further action would be taken by this institution. The library of congress may serve this role. 

Commercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also, the obvious is unpatentable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom. 

Many financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain generally. 

These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. Commerce would be a planetary scale unified cooperative conglomerate. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer commodities are inexpensive.

"We make a crucial thinking mistake to think tech is the solution. Natural habitat comes first, climate is a derivative of that. Co2 is a misleading villain we can blame so we dont have to change our ways."
"Meanwhile, Germany builds coal plants and shutters Nuclear. Also... they closed their solar industry long ago. Oh, and they sold off their semiconductor industry before the boom. Merck sold off the process and IP for lithium ion production in the 90's. Now Germany pulled by 95% of the funding for German battery research. 
 
But Germans regularly protest to express their feelings on BLM at FFF. Generations and generations of bad moves and poor posturing. :facepalm:"
"There’s a lot of great technology and innovation in this video, but don’t scientists realise that gathering energy from space and sending it to earth WILL raise the temperature of the planet?"
Ah yes epoxy oil plastics on steroids
The Earth is a living breathing entity full of life. Climate change has always been a part of its existence
"makes sense to actively overcome climate change within the next few centuries, thereby accelerating renewable energy"
NO
"The most influential entity for the climate is obviously the largest body of the solar system, our central star, the Sun. Nobody speaks about this, not the Scientist not the news. All jab horse maneuver about this and that but not about the entity that has been the focal point of Worship in many ancient cultures. It is the modern man that has lost the meaning of Sun somehow with his brains. The Sun has its own cycles in solar activity that go in different phases. Suns activity is the key influencer of our current climate status that is changing everyday in every corner of the earth. There are also different phases that reach thousands of years and some of them hundreds and micro phases only days and hours. When you face a Sudden Storm or change in temperature it is most likely that the Sun has recently peaked in its activity or vice versa. Climate has always been changing. There has been found exotic hard wood deep inside nordic moss where nowadays only Scrubby birch trees grow. People can't change the climate because they can't change the Sun. Week ago it was -30 degrees celsius and Yesterday it is more like -0 celsius. The sun's activity was going crazy last Friday and it created some turbulences on the earth's atmosphere. I experienced it as high wind winter Storm locally. Today's ""social news science"" doesn't even mention the Sun or its activity. Focus point is in the nonsense. Maybe someone needs to remind us that Sun is the largest central star in our system that is living its own life with its own terms and we are the dancing participants. Sun doesn't give chocolate about your climate politics. It is only one well aimed release of Cosmic gasses and Sun will send us back to blowing in hay whistles. People are so arrogant that they think they can influence something which mass is over 300k times larger than earths. You can't even do a thing to influence the earths businesses. It is the masses that matter, there are so large forces changing the climate that it is impossible to do anything about it. Only thing people can do better is take care of local ecosystems."
😮OMG AlexRadoffe 😂😂
Wouldn’t it further increase the temperature of the Earth if you now pump energy from space? Or the idea is that it replaces fossil?
"This video is such a joke. Title alone is following the uneducated train of thought. Coming out of an ice age, what do you expect? Only one direction. Gonna change our orbit about the sun? Change the sun? So large of a task that only need the tiniest shift, according to such large scales. Way to steal attention and money from the weak. Shoot... What did I just do?"
"Good overview of the exciting things happening in academics.  Is there a similar in-depth overview in the practical progress ongoing today.  For example, how Australia is using solar and battery power.  My home state has shut down its coal plants because renewables are cheaper.  Showing the practical progress like in Denmark and China will get people excited in STEM.
Also, more facts and figures on how industry is starting to aggregate around stable cheaper renewable energy.  This will help industry offer more focused support for the transformation."
What about radiation from the beam in bring back solar connectivity from outer space?
"This is a very good documentary. I just want to point out an observation. The tittle is misleading. WILL renewables stop the climate crisis? i did not catch the answer to this question in this video. To the will the must be a how it will, so i was hoping to find more scientific information from weather / climate / nature fields explaining (in an ideal fully renewable concept) HOW and IF it will make an actual difference to the corse the climate is taking. Still, thanks for the documentary, very interesting. cheers."
"Renewable sources of energy will help create new economy, sustainability and reduce fossil fuel consumption which is the major cause climate change and global warming. All the environmental degradation cause by mining, deforestation, and fossil fuel remain the major influence of climate change. Our source of energy will always determine how we will live our lives in decades to come."
"I think it's important to stick to facts. Something 100% of the Climate terrorists refuse.

We know for a fact, that higher global temperatures results in increase of bio-diversity. 

I'm not sure why Greta Thunberg claims Bio-diversity is a bad thing, but last time I checked it's a good thing"".

Second we know that higher global temperatures results in low-inhabitable lands becoming habitable. Not sure why that is a bad thing.

We also know higher global temperature results in larger biomass on the planet, and more energy for life to thrive. Again not sure why that is bad.

We know in times where global temperature was 8-12 degrees higher than today, that's in Celsius!! - we had 3 times more biomass on the planet and 260 times higher bio-diversity than today.

Ice ages and cold periods did cause mass extinctions!

Ice Ages, Nuclear Winters, global cooling always killed tons of bio-diversity and biomass.. 

These are the facts proven by 100% of the science worldwide.

We also know a hotter temperature causes more H2O in the atmosphere, this will create more rain globally, and we know in these very hot times due to the massive humidity life was thriving, and deserts didn't exist.

Again, not sure why that is bad.

It may be unpleasant sure if humidity is 60% or 80%..

And sure diseases may spread more.. but again is that bad? We humans have all the tools to deal with pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 developed and engineered at the WIV and deliberately and knowingly spread worldwide by the CCP  is a good example how we humans can respond to global threats.

And even if mankind is being wiped out, is that bad for the planet?

As a friend of mine, an international recognized professor and biologist from France studying wildlife worldwide recently has replied to my question:""are you concerned about biodiversity and biomass due to our global warming and the way we treat our planet?""

He replied:""I'm not worried at all about the planet or nature, both will survive whatever may come and whatever we humans do, some bacteria and fungi will always survive even a nuclear total destruction and then they'll kickstart life again and evolution, it's not nature and the planet I'm worried about.. I'm worried about what we do to each other""

I won't use names on the internet, but he's a international recognized French professor saying he's not really worried about nature or the planet when it comes to global warming.

Just some facts 99,99% of the climate terrorists like European Governments, Media and their criminal puppets don't wanna hear of course. 

Since if you tell people:""to save the planet, we don't need to raise your taxes.. well.. might actually then refuse to pay taxes for this nonsense that if I burn my 10 EUR bill on refugee housing, the planet will be saved! ""

Amen"
tenure university professors always claim there are huge job opportunities in their shallow and narrow field of view but that never fits to reality. beaming down solar power with electromagnetic waves are extremely bad idea!
Thanks for the video.  We have all these problems because of the human population size. We need less with more education
"No, not even close. Renewables effect will mostly be on our bills(possibly lower) not on our planet."
"big no. you cannot leave your guard down to build expensive infrastructure that ""may"" help while others are heavily militarizing and do not care about the impact on the environment. You need to deal with the latter to begin to tackle the first. Anything else is bordering on stupidity and negligence"
"The surf and the tide currents are where all the entirely reliable green energy is. It is also where most of the people are so there would be people to build and use the systems. The weather would not matter like it sometimes does with solar and wind. Hydrogen gas made with electricity not used would be the best way to store electricity and could probably be used to power cars, jets, ships, trucks ect."
Climate fraud....
"While many people are trying to make renewable energy.
And lot more than these are wasting alot of energy from all over the world.
The first thing that we need to do is educate them.."
"Run a modern economy purely on solar or wind power?  Impossible, as the wind doesn't blow all the time, and there's something called the seasons and nighttime which interfere with sun rays.  And then there's the small problem of all the minerals you need to mine and process to build, maintain, and replace ""renewable"" energy sources, much less the massive batteries needed for EVs and protection against intermittent power.  Effectively, homo stupidus will replace ravaging the planet for fossil fuels to ravaging the planet for minerals, quite a few of which are rare or are running out already."
Thanks DW for Amazing Documentary❤❤❤
See revelation for context.

"FIRST and foremost, the thousand-plus elites from around the world who attend these phony ""climate crisis meetings"" can be thanked for adding their HUGE carbon footprints to the pollution of the planet. Their private jet emissions emit as much CO2 into the atmosphere as 350,000 vehicles running on gas and these people fly a LOT! Young climate activists are the most uneducated, uninformed group on the facts about ""climate change"" and the ""climate crisis"". They just jump on a bandwagon without doing any research into ALL information from ALL scientists on this subject. The Earth is billions of years old and has never and will not just die suddenly because of a two-degree temperature change. We are most at risk of obliteration from the overdue pole shift, which will be catastrophic, or from a meteor strike. The WEF and elite, self-appointed, super-rich climate ""tsars,"" John Kerry, Al Gore, Klaus Schwab, who fly their private jets around the world, stay at luxury hotels, eat the foods they tell us we must give up (such as beef!) to meet and decide what WE as Americans MUST give up to save the planet while THEY are not giving up anything, not changing THEIR lifestyles in any way. They use climate as a fearmongering tool to gain more control over our lives, to rebuild the US and the world into their Hitleresque vision of a one-world government run by the elites. Please wake up people and see the bigger picture here."
Wind energy is off grid energy. That means no bills or taxes and that's great news.
"Forgot to mention the number of coal energy plants that are china building every year even today..
Otherwise very 👍"
good idea
"The entire country of Portugal ran solely on renewable energy for six days in a row.
Portugal produced 1102 GWh of renewable energy from wind, hydropower and sun, surpassing its demand of 840 GWh, which allowed it to even export electricity to Spain. It’s a record.
About 60% of Portugal’s energy comes from renewable sources today and is expected to run 100% on renewables before 2045."
The world has 1000s of mines currently on fire nobody mentions them at all. Making panels and batteries only polluted us further
"I live in Northern Indiana and remember when I was a kid having snow in October, now we are lucky to have winter with any snow at all. Global warming is happening so much faster than ANYONE wants to admit. For anyone today that has young kids consider them the last generation survive on the planet. We have 50 years max but realistically its going to be more like 25 because in about 10 years time the amount of warming will have gotten so bad that runaway effect will have increased so much that about 10 or 15 years after that the earth WILL have become unlivable to the point that unless you are living underground you would not be able to survive. With everything that is going on in the world today and the fact that WW3 seems to be right around the corner, I have come to the sobering reality that maybe this particular planet and its species just wasn't meant to make it."
"how durable are the solar panels ?
we got Palestinian children that throw rocks"
they kill wild life and destroy the environment.   Is that the world you want for your children?
"Nothing you have done in the way of stopping  fossil fuels has made any effect on the climate. 
The warming if any is all natural. 
You are destroying the worlds economy for no effect?"
"This is almost unwatchable.  If you are a German that believes in energy realism, comment on my post.  I'm working on a campaign to legalize nuclear energy in California to combine renewables + nuclear"
Like most of these doco no.mention of how these things are acheived everything is made with fairy dust and wishes
"Oil production should continue but the oil so obtained should not be burned so as to create GHGs. Rather, it should be used to make Carbon fiber cables for space freight elevators to get all polluting industrial processes out of the habitable zone of our planet and out into space. The habitable zone of the planet should then be reserved exclusively for humans and other living species. With available habitat restored, the ecosystem can then soak up all the excess Carbon that we have dumped into it into the standing stock of plant and animal biomass. (The reason that it is accumulating in the atmosphere and the oceans is because it is not accumulating in the standing stock of biomass fast enough). Ecological restoration and enhancement will require humans to function in their proper and intended roles as the keystone species and stewards of the planet. They should be paid a highly respectable wage for their vitally important work. Let's get started!"
"No they wont, go to that Venice place before it's under water, cheeeers!"

Your film is very good and interesting. It helps my daughter have more ideas about how to make a meaningful science film. Thank you so much.
"Nice day for a drive on the lake.
The earth is 4.5 billion years old. Humans exististence is 200,000 years old. Do the math. Climate change is a scam. Go back to sleep weather boy."
"The problem is far larger than the energy industry and until people stop falling for this delusion, there will be nothing but climate chaos."
🙃
"Yes.  The global economy will also dramatically improve its profit margins, as well.  

Energy prices will start to decline, as reliability will rise from the middle term out."
Hahahahaha.
Why are German energy bills so high ?
Wind turbines are a very expensive environmental disaster.
Unfortunately it will take decades... Time we do not have...
"Can anyone please explain during the 2023 hottest year on record, how the Arctic sea ice extent is at its highest for well over a decade during the whole of December thus far (30/12/2023) currently @ 13.68 million sq. kilometers (27 December 2023) the highest it has been since at least 2009 which is illogical during the new era of global boiling according to the UN ?"
Excellent documentary. Great to hear some positivity about the future of earth and humankind re sustainable energy solutions.
If everyone had a EV and 25% of the population used 50% of their EV to supply the grid (and paid a small amount) then there will be plenty of storage (dispatchable electricity) for the intermittent renewables.
Help developing countries to transition by technology transfer IT traning else you will have alot of china's with quite nice coal power systems
"Space solar power?!!  so to produce lots of emission for the idea of capturing solar energy from the while there is still a lot to do with the solar technology on ""Earth"" ... 
What a waste of money and time in this critical time"
Comment
"With No due respect, The population splitting into different groups is not helping, here's why___

 A Planet for the 99%” draws on research by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and assesses the consumption emissions of different income groups in 2019, the most recent year for which data are available. The report shows the stark gap between the carbon footprints of the super-rich —whose carbon-hungry lifestyles and investments in polluting industries like fossil fuels are driving global warming— and the bulk of people across the world. 

The richest 1 percent (77 million people) were responsible for 16 percent of global consumption emissions in 2019 —more than all car and road transport emissions. The richest 10 percent accounted for half (50 percent) of emissions. 
 
It would take about 1,500 years for someone in the bottom 99 percent to produce as much carbon as the richest billionaires do in a year.  
 
Every year, the emissions of the richest 1 percent cancel out the carbon savings coming from nearly one million wind turbines.
 
Since the 1990s, the richest 1 percent have used up twice as much of the carbon we have left to burn without increasing global temperatures above the safe limit of 1.5°C than the poorest half of humanity. 
 
The carbon emissions of richest 1 percent are set to be 22 times greater than the level compatible with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement in 2030."
You can already put a euqality sign into wealth = pollutions allowances. If tomorrow we introduce Pollution Allowance Points and distribute them equally between world population it will end up accumulated in hands of wealthy people within a year as poor people will just sell their allowances because they can't use them.
"The US military is vast in scale, with a carbon footprint larger than any other institution on earth.Dec 12, 2023 0:00 
Your  opinion is formed on pure ignorance.  Any person with a 80 IQ  can learn to fly a Plane"
Do be a Hypocrite like Greta Thunberg. You would all travel by Private Jet if you had the money!
"If i was that rich, the only time I'd consider using a private plane is if there had been a family emergency (e.g. someone had been in an accident and was in bad shape in hospital) and i had to get back as fast as possible. 
Other than that, I'll just fly on a commerical flight like everyone else. I'll still get to where I'm going."
"The rich and arrogant will be humbled.  Now that you know how God feels about opulent wealth, how do you think that translates into your experience after death?  Greed is something you should avoid at all costs because of the impacts to your life, those around you, the planet, and also your eternal soul."
"Humans miseducate humans by calling our Creators already planned clean ups, climate change, to attempt to make humans fearful.  
The Future is here to awaken all Spirits who are willing, as promised to us.  The Time has come to be in an Environment of Completion for those who chose to Love only.  We all were given a purpose for this important Time period.  Make the Natural Selection (choose Love) and Live to see it.  Future says words similar to ""rich"" will be absent in the Future.  Equality will be clearly seen in the near Future.  2030 Will be Peace on Earth."
"Clearly, the majority of wealthy people don't give a damn about climate change & how it will impact humanity as a whole so long as it doesn't have any negative effect on them. Their sense of entitlement & their greed is every bit as obscene as their wealth as is their refusal to sacrifice any part of their luxurious lifestyle for the good of the planet & for future generations. So, until these arrogant a**holes like this lot & those in control of big industry wake up to themselves, fighting climate change will be a losing battle. Then, those apocalyptic films that depict the poor being segregated to live their lives in barren wastelands while the wealthy live in a utopian paradise will become our new reality & the only legacy that the wealthy will leave behind will be the resentment of those who outlive them for the way in which they willfully destroyed the planet & condemned most of us to a living hell. So long as the wealthy have the money & the power to keep pulling the strings of politcians & lawmakers, they will always prosper no matter what & the rest of us will have to pay the price."
Herrrrr! This guy on the plane get nerves. An epitome of exhibiting pride in wealth over an issue of global concern.
"it could be interesting an CO2 allowance per capita where people could sell part. but almost impossible to control, maybe with average and statistic data. it would allow poor people make some money and the rich people not loose the quality of life they are used to."
Please don't pretend to be 9outraged to find out the rich don't give a sh-t about anyone but themselves... this is capitalism at work and the flaw of capitalism is that it has no conscience or moral compass..
"Here's something to think about -> The carbon footprint is because of private jet, yacht etc. Sure, the rich person is using this, but someone is making it too - that is employment. One could say, stop making these luxury goods entirely. Where does that take us... some emission will decrease, but still the bulk of people have an order of magnitude higher footprint than 1% rich. What does that mean... population reduction. Now that gets uncomfortable to discuss, doesn't it?"
What a creep that guy Schellnhuber is🤢
Start burning their luxury.. 2:46
Rich pollute but poor suffer from pollution
"When we talk about pollution, taking good care of ourselves and preventing harm is really important for our health. Planet Ayurveda has products and meal plans that can help. Their products are great for keeping us healthy because they're made from natural herbs."
"LOL, I love how everyone focues on what 1% of the population does - I get that they make 10,000 times the waste.  That's still less than 1% of the global waste!!!!  FFS, look at industry.  Super Low Hanging Fruit.  Make a 10% impact on industries that cause the most waste and you will impact +5% of waste.  Do the same for the wealthy and the impact will be a fraction of 1%. . ."
"The rich has always right :). Only problem for them is ""not enough money""."
"Julien shows the exact reason why it never worked and it never will until they get thrown into jail for not doing it. Sorry but restrictions have to apply if it doesn't work the other way, it's the same as his mum did when he was small and wanted to eat chocolate all day, she put on a restriction and he ate less chocolate."
"Strange that the growth of plants and animals was massive when CO2 levels were much, much higher...  

The planet has more often not had ice at the poles ....   Most people don't know... 

None of these climate alarmists can discuss this...   Climate scaremongering has become a type of religious cult..

Look at the people pushing these agendas..  They are making billions from WEF led politicians making laws to crucify the people... Taxing the already poor to have less and less whilst they are forced to pay tax penalties just to live.. 

Why do they not talk about energy conservation or world overpopulation?  They don't because there is less money to be made there.. 

Wake up fools and do your own research..."
"It’s not just the wealthy lifestyle, it’s more the way they make their money and the destruction to the planet by everything involved with industrial activities."
"Greta is perfect example of this. She keeps saying climate this and climate that, yet she travels with airplane from one country to another to say those stupid things. Hypocrite."
this guys is bastard more ii watched this documentary more I feel people like him shouldn't exist pretty egoist saying travelling by bus is  gross and his part of a elite
There are thousands of flights everyday. Rich people are not the problem
Utter loads of crap...
He's part of the problem. But the biggest part of the problem are people not in his position but same attitude. I understand why the psychopaths would be like that. But why do ordinary people think the same when they have so much to lose?
"300 kilos of co2 for a weekend , i dont believe it, thats around 150 liters of petrol , i dont believe it"
"Good thing Bill Gates doesnt own private jets.......Oh wait.  Kidding aside, its funny how all the wealthy climate activists own or travel by private jet.  Rules for thee, but not for me."

"The most efficient way to reduce CO2 emmissions, is by moving people from warm and cold climates to mediocre climates. The cost of cooling is very high and heating also. 
 I dont know why the media focusses on private travel so much."
"can we as consumers identify these entitled people, and boycott their businesses?"
"If we could find a way to turn the rich's entitlement and arrogance into energy, we would have solved the fossil fuels dependency problem"
"I agree that the bubble the rich is living in, while being aware of climate change, is extremely depressing. Otoh. _they_ are the ones who'll obviously be loosing their whole lifestyle to fit the needed CO2 budget. The ""poorer"" people can't do much else than they are already doing, which by coincidence is good for the climate - so it's easy from them to say that they are efficient, and wanting rich people to be much more efficient. 

Climate change is not directly controlled by efficiency - sending out more CO2 in the ecosystem than was there before is the problem - which means; fossile fuels is the problem. You can be as inefficient as you want, as long as the energy is green. Efficiency of people - i.e. their CO2 budgets - is only relevant because we still rely heavily on fossile fuels. Lowering living-standards to fit CO2 budgets will therefore be a temporary transition, if we are only talking about solving climate change."
"How ironic, the rich are polluting like there's no tomorrow, yet they are the ones that have the wealth to make a choice that makes a positive difference. Meanwhile poor people in undeveloped countries constantly take the blame for contributing to climate change, when they have no choice but to burn trees for fuel to cook."
"what a surprise, the rich are selfish!"
"2:56 ""A flight by private jet emits tons of green house gasses"" does that actually mean it uses tons of fuel?"
I want to fight climate change form a private jet
That individual on the plane displayed an excessive amount of arrogance. It might be worth considering boycotting his company.
Mr. Goebells would be proud of you DW. Amazing propaganda piece!
"Most of rich are old, and climate crisis don’t really relevant to this group. Sad case/"
"So if the plain emits carbon gasses is that the owners fault that bought the plain to go places faster so he can do more business or the manufacturer that is not competent to make a 0 emmision plain, or the goverment that approve that the plain can be used?"
"There will come a time in which we clearly see it has been too late, and everyone will turn to scientists and they'll say ""nope you had your chance we warned you, but you didn't care and ignored us."""
Meanwhile California has banned high powered gaming PCs and new York city is expecting pizza parlors to immediately upgrade to electric solar powered pizza ovens to you know curb green house gasses -_-
The level of arrogance of that “fairly rich” guy is astounding.
"The minister said it himself: governments address wealth inequality through taxation. Because the government of Germany, like the government here in the US, has shown no inclination to address wealth inequality through taxation, people like the family in this video will continue to pay the cost of addressing the climate crisis right beside people in the developing world. Until people like the family shown in the video demand, through all means necessary, that their governments address the situation, they will continue to pay the cost. The daughter can anticipate the much lower standard of living identified by the expert in the video. By ""all means necessary,"" I mean everything from voting to protests to breaking things."
"These people should be put in jail. HOW IS IT OKAY when a horrible man like that pays ""just 8000 euros"" for a flight here and there, while others have to work so hard to get by in Germany. Absolutely disgusting."
"Thanks DW for this video!! I've been saying this for years! Rich people account for so much of the climate being destroyed, and of course the poor people are going to pay the price. It's HIGH TIME, the rich started to drive and fly with us, to cut costs, and save our planet. ABSOLUTE BLANKET BAN for these horrible people needs to be introduced ASAP."
"I agree with paying for your co2 emission...but depending on your wage and financial situation!

I also want people to pay for the water they use.

I live in Québec, Canada and I can tell you that people (especially old people) do NOT CARE about their water consumption! 
They wash the street in front of their house and let the water flow like it was nothing!!

We are fortunate to be located where there is an abundance of potable water, but we take it for granted unfortunately. 

I wish we had to pay for it, depending on your home situation: how many people in house, salary, etc."
"Capital ostracises the wealthy from society -  social wealth is many times more richer than private wealth - its incomparable - and its under attack constantly (public spaces/transport etc) they will realise the expensively taxing vacuous lifestyle they have led in order to achieve the same pleasure from engaging with the world that the average middle class person could, had wealth been more equally distributed."
Thankyou so much for this video👍😊
"They are making public transport less attractive these days, just look at the crime and terrorism that is on the rise in Western Europe thanks to idiotic left wing policies."
Meanwhile China and India continue to build new coal power stations on a monthly basis. But Marxist DW would rather have you believe that a few rich guys in Europe are to blame LOL
"Without neglecting the value of this reporting, the amount of long distance travel in general have increased. Traveling by car with just one or two passengers including people who drive petrol guzzlers collectively have the same effect. As soon as one has increased income tends to buy big cars to use to daily to take kids to school or soccer practice, travel overseas twice a year for a holiday etc. would be interested a reporting on that too. Climate change and environmental crises is real and complex, there are deny-ears, ignorant and as well as those who simply don’t care rich or poor."
Know i know who DW really is funded by :))))
The guy in the plane?  You sanctimonious piece of crap !!
"The guy on the plane is like Trump, but Trump trumps it.  He fly on that behemoth of a plane everywhere he goes.  And he is running for president.  He already took us out of the Paris accord."
How selfish can you get!!!😠😠😠👹💩
"people often complain about wealthy people, but the real problem is our government make us believe that the wealty people are the real problem."
Cool. I've got another touchy topic for a documentary. Rich people and trophy hunting. That's bad for the climate and biodiversity.
Who will stop this irresponsible behaviour?  Maybe Elon Musk:)
"Talk about guilt tripping rich people, and depicting less wealthy people as victims and hearing that they blame rich people for not doing all they can to reduce their emissions. Perpetuating divide between people even more it seems is this documentary's goal. When China emits more than Western Europe combined each year, and so do India and the US. Most emissions in the world are from those three countries industrial businesses.
In other matters driving a Ferrari is a few years worth less polluting than any Electric vehicle when bought new from a show room, and doesn't give demand to China, India or the US for parts, production, and shipping, those countries will also import raw materials from African countries to make these electric vehicles in their own countries before sending them across the world.
So in conclusion a Ferrari is made in cleaner and more environmentally friendly ways, and more fuel efficient (less polluting) in transporting to European customers."
"If you look statistically, industrial businesses emit more greenhouse emissions than private citizens and the road haulage industry combined (I know this to be true for the UK, and is probably the same for most European countries). So to target private citizens as the ones to take the burden is a preached falsehood.
Owning, buying or using an older car/vehicle is always better for the environment than buying a new electric car. As buying new vehicles promotes more global demand and pollution in production and transport, and with electric vehicles especially more slave labour for the minerals that make up lithium batteries from within African countries. Governments are brain washing their populations into believing that they need to make personal sacrifices for the environment and to have electric vehicles. Another capitalist short term approach."
"Co2 caps are stupid. Pretending youre going to lower temps or that it would be a good thing is asinine. If somebody tells you they have the answers, theyre lying. I will however agree rich people FAR affect climate moreso than any subgenre. And theyre the loudest ppl calling for climate regulation. I hate them all."
"Here are just a few of the most egregious lies which are told by this miserable band of lunatics:

They claim that the climate has changed and is changing rapidly. What they don’t bother to mention is that the climate has always changed. It has changed for billions of years and will doubtless continue to do so. Although a good many lies are told there is no evidence that these changes have been exacerbated or accelerated by cows, motor cars or aeroplanes.
They claim that the world is heading for a crisis. They have been forecasting this for decades. Every specific forecast has come and gone without anything happening. Claims that the sea is going to rise to dangerous levels are entirely fictitious and are nothing more than reckless, irresponsible scare mongering.
No one knows just what damage carbon dioxide emissions may do or how relevant they are. The increase in the amount of carbon dioxide began before oil and gas were in wide use. Human beings themselves are natural producers of carbon dioxide and many of those promoting the climate change myth believe that the answer is to reduce the world’s population from around 8 billion down to 500 million."
"We need a global revolution against this arrogant rich people,they are the biggest problem of the world!"
"3 tons per year. does that mean peolpe will be forced to wear CO2 measuring masks? welcome to new world order, sheep. how actualy will paying for excess CO production will help the climate?"
"Economy should run on the basis of circulation of health, hygiene and safety and not on the basis of circulation of paper and electronic money."
"Every family has that one person who will break the family's financial struggle, I hope you become the one 😊"
The 1st person is honest
"Wie finde ich die deutsche Version?
Where can I find the German version"
President Joe Biden held an Electric Vehicle Summit at the beginning of his administration. He did not invite Elon Musk. That should give you an idea of how warped our political leaders are. California taxes and regulations are so horrific that Musk moved Tesla headquarters to Texas. And the State of California let him go! Consider all the jobs and tax revenues that went with him. This is the kind of wisdom we are dealing with.
"There is no  ""CO2 Allowance""! Terrible concept that is beeing propagated here. Society of guilt."
Its the elite super rich and powerful groups who are pushing this climate change shut down of every ordinary citizens lifestyle. So why even bother with this crap of information. They are above it and everyone else is subject to it.
"Comparing “the rich” with “the poor” does not paint the proper picture of this problem. How much are the CO2 emissions of individuals compared with those of the industries? How about the big polluters to be “punished” through taxes and trade bans and we’ll see that instead of 3t of CO2 /year we could live with the 7/10t of CO2 the average individual emits without an issue. 

Even the burnt wood and fallen trees emits CO2 if not removed from the forests and processed. This is just one of the scenarios with an easy fix. 

From a person’s perspective, yes, it’s not fair that one gets to pollute more and get away with it, but “just looking at trees we might miss the forest”."
you guys also need to consider in order to earn that kind of money he needs to provide significantly valuable service to society.climate is constantly changing throughout the history of time.there was age of constant fire throughout earth at the start later ice age now we come to Moderna day.we need to make smart measure to prevent pollution collectively and individually.thank you for the video
"Because the rich know what the rest of the population aren’t allowed to know, the climate catastrophe is rubbish. Its politics, not facts."
I don't like the constant blaming of private people. It should't  everyone's personal dilemma while big corporations and governments have the responsibility.
First thing to do is have  all the UN climate converences by zoom. That would save millions of tons and the supposedly most concerned could demonstrate their purity.
It is only a matter of time before the governments seize control with digital currency and control what you can buy. One of the first targets for restrictions will be fossil fuels.
I don't like the way how they try to make the people feel bad who emit more co2. This whole climate change debate is so annying. Climage has always changed and will change. For sure humans accelarte that but we should not try to go back to middle age this is worse tha  the whole world going down. We should invest in new technology.
Income inequality and Climate change are two separate issues. I don't see how inciting lower income population against the wealthy will benefit humanity
Sad but true.
Just because your rich doesn’t mean your safe from being a piece of trash person that’s a virus to the Earth.
Mariensiel not Wilhelmshaven
"As a student in geography and working on research pertaining to climate change, these documentaries are quite hilarious to me. I get it, these rich people indulge in activities that have a larger carbon footprint than an average joe but their lifestyle is a mere drop in the bucket. Our real issues arise from the general use and production of fossil fuels and our dependency on livestock to feed ourselves and there isn't much we can do about it, the near future is completely bleak and governments are not willing to take action right now, even if these guys completely stopped their luxurious activities, we still wouldn't make any sort of impact in the fight against climate change.
These documentaries do nothing but direct attention to something that will not help us in the fight against climate change regardless of how much we demonize these rich people, they are pretty big assholes but unfortunately they are not enough to fight against climate change. The real targets of documentaries should be politicians in the pockets of oil companies that refuse to make changes and stop policies that will actually help make an impact."
"These people are tyrannical beyond belief and will drive people into poverty for no better reason than they are resentful and bitter that people have more than them. “Saving the planet” is just their excuse and it is disgusting! These elitist fascists and communists need to be kept as far away from power as possible to prevent them from breaking the free enterprise which has and is reducing absolute poverty all over the world at very fast rate. Any talk of climate mitigation measures and punitive taxation and regulation without talk of their economic effects, especially on the poor, is destined to do far more harm than good."
Climate change activists don’t care about the climate as much as breaking capitalism. They can’t stand it. They sooner make everyone poor if it meant they were “equal”

So let's be poor yeah😂
Rich people are REALLY hated around the world😂😂😂
The business is throughly honest ... Alot of us would take the private jets if we could. The convince and comfort is just unparalleled.
This is why a lot of people don’t take climate change seriously because the people who are preaching it don’t take it seriously and contribute more emissions than the average person. They want u to give up your small luxuries but they won’t theirs. Doesn’t seem fair innit.
0:58 not everyone can behave like him because not everyone can afford a private jet

Amazing crotex land vilage
"Man, sick in the head, refugees are coming let's let all fall and run to the ocean.... CRAZY"
"And what happens in an event where earthquake hits the cables and they disconnect straight into the water 😂 and this idiot is proud to live in his place. It's a death trap, this guy Sasha is delusional"
"I've never heard anyone in my country (Australia) acknowledge what a life affected by global warming would be like for us here.

I wonder if that's part of what we need 🤔"
Their climate change predictions have been wrong for more than 40 years.
The weather and climate are about the same as when I was born.
"""Life with the Tides"" explores innovative solutions to the looming threat of rising sea levels. It's both inspiring and thought-provoking, showcasing how human creativity can adapt to the challenges of climate change. Thank you for presenting these visionary projects for a more resilient future."
"It's a great idea in a way and works well for now but there will be much bigger Strom's and waves ,so the floating homes will be smashed by waves higher then you think,so cities and living under water is a better idea ,don't waste money and time on floating homes"
The speaker’s voice sounds like the speaker at ted i have once heard
We can't stop global warming... 😅
How do you get  food to your house if sourundled  by water
"Trying to imagine your house sinking into the ocean.   It's inevitable, this seems like a really bad idea."
Whoa i can barely afford to go slay the mountains in my area let alone on a different continent
"this still feels outdated. cooling the house because it sits on water? No, all sea life is going to die because sea water is warming up and absorbing the excess carbon dioxide in our air from human life. we need to cool the water. Even better yet, return the Earth back to it's natural state.
And... the rich will live on land. The poor will have to live on the sea, and they cannot afford these concept houses."
💝❣️💖💘💞💟💗
Ice cap submarines can prevent sea levels why because so it can covert to fresh water to strong ice
There’s no choice we must stop climate change and built ice cap submarines and floating lands and cities and underwater cities that has strong break glass that doesn’t break
We must built ice cap submarines that can prevent ice caps that are melting that’s important that project cost 4 or 5 billions of dollars
"I not be investing in to property much, witch it not be that safe. I reader investing as nation  together do something about climate change. And as You all , I hope know , unfortunately You cant live one day on MARS , as Musk think so. Sorry real reality is real and if nothing about it will happened, You will all swim very soon. As lost Atlántida, in time ,in back in time ."
i like water
Dutch seems to be most progressive nation on planet at the moment. Love them
That’s terrible they should build strong flood walls in bangladesh
But you need a lot of money to live on the water 😂
"We have since along time ago, times with naturally climat changing days etc
Is not new
What you like develop? You like develop more catastrophies, that people died? Or?"
Glad to see Jaques Custuao getting a call out. the  man was a visionary.
"the end of the last ice age created the coasts we have today, it is just the planet doing what the planet does."
this will not work long term.
"Shanghai wouldn't flood, they can easily build flood gates"
False

"Oh the seaorbiter, i’ve seen the big model irl twice in the last 10 years, France is so smart when it comes to the ocean. Cousteau and Verne were my childhood idols"
Isn't the cure worse than the disease? I can think of a hundred problems of living on water in a two storey home.
"As per some of the comments below, I would think doing more than painting this as an answer, but an in-depth analysis of possibilities AND drawbacks...any boat owner knows being on the water means very high maintenance costs...ecological impact (since undoubtably all these people will want highly polluting motorboats), and what happens when these things age...so much material in the dump...then there is sewage and water disposal...and do the remaining above water lands become all industrial?  We have to stop pretending we can find ways to carry on ""as usual"" and find ways to reduce our impact rather than expand them.  There are serious ownership and taxation issues with this as well, easements for current waterfront owners etc.  I love these documentaries where we are at least talking about it, but only covering the ""fun ideas"" is not good journalism. No one is talking about reducing our numbers or our per capita consumption.  This is a war, and we rationed during wars...what the heck is the matter with us now?  (been taking the rationing approach for more than 15 years now, and have no kids...this has allowed me to make my own choices and has given me a massive amount of financial freedom)"
Water give life and also take it

Please redo the calculations because you guys are wrong by a lot."
Now I am getting the Avatar movie 2.
This   Aspect  is not feasible   In Most countries as the. Storms would wipe them out !
We just have to move inland that is all  that is why I. Left the coast !
I always remember that movie water world it was frightening
But what happens with bad weather !  This is only in places where they don’t get bad weather ! And how many places are there that dont get bad weather ?  For instance the coast of America and Japan ?
But the Gulf Stream is stopping and that means another ice age ?
Thumb pic is at 23:58 if that's what made you click on this video
Informative video ❣️
"About 30 years ago an architect in Britain demonstrated a house built on 4 columns floating inside wells built into the ground. When the water level was low the house rested on the ground. As the water level rose the columns would be pushed up by the water, lifting the house. So, self-levelling, always dry and laterally stable as the columns are suported on all sides.

And in the 80s there was a french startup which prototyped an affordable 4 seater amphibious family car. 

Really no need to reinvent the wheel."
"I have questions. 
The richest people in America have purchased massive mansions along Martha's vineyard and Pelosi just bought herself a coastal mansion along Florida's coast. 
Why are the leaders of the climate change crisis purchasing massive homes where they say water levels will rise, and drown the lands"
It will not hold longer.
"It was global warming, propaganda, know  climate change, propaganda 😮"
China the most polluted air and rivers.

Great movie!👍👍
"The water looks so calm in these ""water worlds."" :O/-

Would love to see some realistic aquatic living facilities."
Those architecture designs are just silly.
"Floating skyscrapers? I think the idea is a bit risky, first of all we have to think about Archimedes' law and then we have to think that in the open sea after the temperature increases by 0.5-1 degree Celsius, about once every 5-6 years you would have a hurricane through the Netherlands, about level 3. In Tuvalu, I don't want to think, it will be the same in Florida, except that here the hurricanes will be level 5. What floating buildings do architects dream of in the conditions where large tonnage ships, with engines of tens of thousands of horsepower and anchors of tens of tons avoid these storms, and it is a nightmare to approach the coast with them in hurricane conditions."
Those Dutch houseboats don't seem very future proof as the dock pilings only seem to have about 1 meter of room left for the boats to rise.
"I have a climate change, in my pants!"
"It is always amazing to me the extent of pseudo science that is among the so called ""scientists"", as those in this  video.   All of this video's talk of rising sea levels is based on ZERO proof and ZERO science.  This is total and complete crap.  In 1980, the Global Warming Scientists and the UN agreed that the Arctic Ocean would be totally free of ice by the year 2000.  In fact today the Arctic Ocean has more ice accumulation than it did in 1980.  The conclusion is that the Arctic region, during the last 40 years has slightly cooled and not warmed.  Why don't you idiots start using real science and actual observations instead of following the grant money at the Dumb Ass  PhD post Doc University that you are spending your entire career at.  Stop smoking that stuff and look at reality."

"""if climate change continues??"" is this video serious?"

This is awesome! But what happens when there are typhoons or tsunamis? These architectural designs are unique and beautiful!

What happened when there is a bad storm? Are there plans made to offset a storm?
We trash everything we touch the more scientifically we get the worst it is. There are ocean animals that are beaching themselves and we wonder why. Did I read one of you out there fixing to clear power was going to be the best thing for the world's wealth look what it's done it's gotten into oceans God only knows how much nuclear waste we put in our bodies when we eat fish or shellfish? We have gone to the Moon and left our trash there also. I think it's time we stayed home and tried to figure out our resources and try to figure out how to neutralize nuclear weapons and pollution. Now the scientists are worried about climate change which in some parts they are to blame for all their outer space and inner space. Knowledge is a good thing except for when you destroy us by it. Stop a rocket from going into space trying to get to some planet where we think we might be able to live if we kill list one. Spend the money on fixing this one. Everyone worries and talks about it but no one is very few I've tried to do something about it.
"Amazing technology.  Venice is built on water for hundreds of years and it is still there.  Of course, from what I have read a lot of repairs are being done now."
At least they dont have to mow the lawn.

I love how the things people say as an argument that I should be concerned about climate change are always the same reasons I'm all for climate change. You just listed the shittiest city's in the world and said they will be under water.  Good!!!! Lol wtf why would anyone care if  DC or Shanghai is under water
"Watching the global elite use the climate change scam to solidify even more power is disturbing. Disturbing that so many plebes can’t see it for what it is, another means of controlling the masses."
Good. Because once we are gone the world will revert to that wonderful tropical paradise when there were no polar ice caps at the time of the dinosaurs. It was 8 degrees C higher then than now; talk about lovely global warming.

The real disaster will occur if we  attach any credibility to this drivel and then allow these clowns to successfully ban fossil fuels. Our energy resources allow us to have civilization. Anthropogenic climate change is a concocted boogeyman. .

"2:12  There is no correlation between CO2 in the atmosphere and global warming.  Global warming has been at about 1°C for over thirty years!   Global warming was reported at 1.1°C in 1991.  In 2022 global warming was reported at 1.06°C typically rounded to 1.1°C.  It is not possible to cause global warming by changing atmospheric greenhouse gases. 

Earth's greenhouse effect is the model of a system always in saturation from the strong greenhouse gas water vapor to add 10°F (5.55°C) to earth's average temperature that takes place within 20 meters of the surface.  After 20 meters from the radiating surface all the greenhouse radiant energy has been completely absorbed by greenhouse gases.   Its further heat transfer is by convection i.e. gas molecules bumping into each other.

The United Nation's IPCC science is truthful in the back pages of its 200 page science report it is not dealing with active greenhouse gases or earth's greenhouse effect where it states is took its greenhouse gas samples at 20,000 meters altitude and only that one altitude!   If this were real science it would be expected the entire air column would be sampled."

the planetary warming is getting hotter by the week a swedish environmental scientist has been comparing charts and a weather pattern change is due to global rain cloud accumulating low pressures the planet is facing a massive drying effect in the coming years the shift in Celsius is going to be climbing up by degrees at a concerning rate we may face water shortage in uk gb and are faced with having implement water storage to facilitate the hotter clearer sky and due to global rain cloud combination we in middle to northern europe and uk gb are going to have to be ready for the hot less humid rise in thermal dynamic heat.

Managing population displacement because of climate change is crucial. Resistance to accepting immigrants is very common. Humans need to get past this and work out ways to integrate immigrants efficiently. Violent conflict will be inevitable if we fail to find ways to peacefully cooperate.

I suppose it should be beleived. Cows are a significant or a very significant factor in global warming.  How much land area can be used for food other then a cattle. Shouldn't governments be paying farmers a supplementary income. To provide food other then from cows. Make quick changes from cattle. Don't first wacth the waters devastate.

Pakistan had a huge impact of climate change and India has been measuring how much the country is being affected by the glaciers and what measures can be taken. Bangladesh is being affected with rising sea levels mainly in the southern parts. Netherlands I think have taken good measures in combating coastal flooding and the Dutch I presume are also committed in providing 50% of their electricity through renewable sources like wind and solar.

"The good news about global warming is that it’s not being caused by increasing solar output or any other natural uncontrollable cause — and also that mankind generally understands that it’s the ‘amplified greenhouse effect’ which is responsible for global temperature increases. With this in mind, it behooves us to rapidly advance and apply our scientific and technological knowledge to the point that the burning of fossil fuels to produce electricity will become as antiquated as the burning of whale oil for light.
Quote: “Anxiety must go. It must be replaced by faith and solemn confidence in the outworking of the divine plan.”

Note: As sunlight (photons) is warming the surface of the world, surface heat energy is also radiating away from our planet in the form of ‘infrared radiation’ which passes freely thru the atmospheric gases of nitrogen and oxygen which do not absorb heat. Indeed, if it weren’t for greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide that ‘do interact’ strongly with infrared energy and ‘impede the escape’ of  Earth’s radiant heat, then the planet would be perpetually frozen solid. Thankfully, even though greenhouse gases comprise only 4/10ths of one percent of the atmosphere, they are so powerful that they maintain a ‘blanketing effect’ by constantly ‘absorbing and releasing’ infrared heat energy over and over, again and again. In doing so, they gyrate wildly, thus causing them to vigorously collide with other atmospheric molecules which, in turn, collide with other air molecules, imparting the kinetic energy of motion throughout the atmosphere — and this vibratory state registers as temperature.

The smartest idea to save our planet is to have everybody to stop flying jet planes and rockets of all kinds because their hot exhaust is adding way too much heat into our atmosphere! We must all go back to only flying propeller airplanes because they do not heat up our atmosphere ever! Let's do it and save Earth!

"Interesting. I had thought when they started to talk about capturing the CO2 that they would reuse it to burn/heat something. Instead it is being put into the ground, filling up the holes.

Excellent. Keep up the good work
Save the planet? What incredible hubris. Earth has  experienced climactic changes in the past  that are orders of magnitude more intense than anything we can create ourselves no matter how hard we try. Can our CO2 emissions create  hardship for humanity? Maybe. But to suggest we can kill the planet much less save it is hubris that flies in the face of scientific reality.
"Space industry needs to be designed for bring on from planet to the earth.  Likewise, gold and silver and titanium and others also gaasoline😢"
"It's great to see companies trying combat the CO2 problem with tech however, as the last scientist said, ""why not stop emitting CO2 in the first place""  We do have a definite solution, just no one wants to be responsible for it."
"Nope.  Technology can't replace the billions of hectare we dug up and gassed off in an effort to expand a completely unsustainable Industrial Agriculture model to the 4 corners of the developed and developing world.  Even if the perfect carbon capture technology somehow sprang into existence 50 years ago, and we spent all available hours of human labor on building a global carbon capture system that is guaranteed to work flawlessly and never pose a threat of catastrophic disruption...

...we'd still need another 200 years to finish building it.

The ONLY actual solution we have is to repair the carbon cycle by rebuilding the global Rhizosphere and, through the processing of around 24% of our yearly organic waste back into living ecosystems, extract carbon from the atmosphere and store it in living ecosystems that over time will decay down into the soil, rather than back up into the atmosphere.

Nature already knows how store carbon and scale globally.  All we have to do is restart the process by sorting and spreading our organic waste as castings and frass over millions of acres of land, and get out of its way.

Everything else is a lie told to make money or push a political agenda.  Remember this kids.  If they don't say ""Carbon Cycle, Rhizosphere, and Life is Carbon"" they are telling you a story about a bridge they have for sale."
it's a scam..
"If technology advances at an exponential rate, wouldn't it be reasonable the say that by 2030 science will have a solution to climate change, why are Governments panicking? 
Or could it be that we have unreleased technology but its about global UN/WHO population control?"
Why can’t we pull carbon out of the oceans and use the hydrogen as a byproduct to power hydrogen fuel cells in vehicles in turn creating way less co2 and selling the hydrogen to pay for the cost of processing it ✌️❤️👍
"I’ve learn in petroleum engineering we can use CO2 for EOR injection process to reduce oil density in the oil reservoir, but compare to water injection the CO2 are more expensive,  hope the CO2 capture technology are getting reliable to use in the future."
"God's Wrath
With our downgraded food chain as a result of GMO and semi-useless chemical fertilizers that generate growth but not nutrition, water systems that use several chemicals in the lines to purify pipes and more, and medicine that quit looking for cures long ago, and now only release remission agents so they can bilk a person for life, we are doomed. As a result of low-nutrition foods we have minimal immune systems that will not be able to handle any real epidemics, and with drugs designed not to cure, if you run out you die.

Not only that but our endorsement of LGBTO has incurred the wrath of God and is one of the reasons for the destruction of humanity at the time of the flood of Noah's Ark.

Today I saw a comment about how Germany is burning African coal while the African people suffer loadshedding due to lack of coal. Why? What is the excuse and how do these token actions make up for this? There is a lot more harm being done than good it seems.
Too little too late.... Much better now to invest our efforts into finding ways to lessen the suffering that will ensue from the disasters that we have already initiated.
I find it ‘interesting’ how Sunak has rolled back on his climate pledges in the face of so called climate change. Just confirms to me we are being lied to.
"If you want to reduce/remove CO2 from the atmosphere quickly? Reverse desertification! Unfortunately I doubt that much money can be made in doing this, so it’s unlikely that businesses will bother!"
Please keep perspective. No large amounts of C02 are not sequestered in comparison to the emissions. The fossil fuel industry when pushed said emissions capture is not viable and most credits are junk. Just another excuse to continue destroying the biophysical basis of humans existence. Insane global governance
"This all sounds nice and everything but sadly, it's too late.

Statistics show that by 2056 there will be a projected global population of 10 bilion, which exceeds what our planet can support simply from an agricultural standpoint.

"We need to do everything we can to slow climate change. We already have the technology to have net zero energy buildings. We also have electric vehicle technology. And we have wind and solar power. And we can reforest large areas of the earth. And reduce the number of cattle that produce methane. And reduce population growth. We just need to implement these already existing technologies on a massive scale. Yes, new technologies might be good too, but we don't have to wait on them. We can do what needs to be done with existing technologies."
Wait Climate Change is real? I thought it was just a fictional story for kids
"I didn't like any of the techniques for removing CO2 from the atmosphere that were discussed in this vid.  Nature already knows how to remove CO2 with its own marvelous invention called trees.  Companies should be planting lots of trees all around the earth, but they can't do that because under the present definition of 'profit', planting lots of trees would be too expensive.  If we want to reverse man-made climate change, we must first correct the meaning of economic expenses, and the only way to do that is by changing the definition of profit.
How about this definition: 'Profit = protecting and enriching the environment, and sharing the sustenance that if provides to all of us'.  Now our major expense would be ignoring our responsibility to protect and enrich the environment.  This new profit model would create millions of new jobs that will come under the heading ""Caretakers of the Environment"".  Caretakers will earn higher wages then most other jobs.  With this new profit model, companies can make products that will last for a much longer time.  They can simply, and without fear of bankruptcy, scale back production as the market becomes saturated with products.  As they scale back production, they will need to reduce the size of their workforce, but the workers who lose those jobs will earn higher wages as ""Caretakers"".  There will always be a very high demand for Caretakers because caring for the environment is our main objective, especially under this new profit model.

Technological solutions might help, but not as our first step.  If we continue to operate by 'profit = income - expenses', every effort we make to slow or reverse man-made climate change will not only fail, but will actually make the situation much worse than it already is.  This old profit model is the cause of most homelessness today and it is also the core cause of man-made climate change.  

p.s.  It may be too late to create a new Global Economic Model that is based on this new definition of 'profit', but it is never too late to try; besides, there is no other viable choice. 💖"
"Honest question......is the quantity of co2 we exhale as humans miniscule in comparision to the burning of fossil fuels and wouldn't planting more vegetation be an easier fix to the problem seeing as platns absorb same naturally.....again, honest question."

"Maybe as a consequence of right wing abdication into climate change denial, the left have written the narrative on environmentalism to accord with their political leanings, unopposed by any attempt to secure a prosperous AND sustainable future. The sympathy between Limits to Growth and Marxism is obvious. However, Earth is a big ball of molten rock. Converted to base load electricity and clean burning hydrogen fuel, Magma Energy could supply global energy demand carbon free, many times over, forever - and also surplus energy to desalinate, irrigate, recycle and capture carbon. 
Developing Magma Energy technology globally over the next several decades is out there; but there's a very real, global scale threat that implies significant change this century. Magma Energy is not more far fetched than the left's anti-capitalist de-growth proscription, nor more disruptive than climate, economic and ecological catastrophe.Transcending Limits to Growth with Magma Energy should at least inform the context of decision making; it should be acknowledged that a prosperous and sustainable future is technologically possible. 

Status of the Magma Energy Project
Dunn, J. C. (Sandia National Labs., Albuquerque, NM.)
Abstract
The current magma energy project is assessing the engineering feasibility of extracting thermal energy directly from crustal magma bodies. The estimated size of the U.S. resource (50,000 to 500,000 quads) suggests a considerable potential impact on future power generation. In a previous seven-year study, we concluded that there are no insurmountable barriers that would invalidate the magma energy concept."
To stop co2 pollution they decided to pollute air with even more harmful sulfur gas. Brilliant idea...
the real question is can we save our selves from politics. This Climate business is only about politics and it is hurting everyone else.

"The promise of a technological solution is often an excuse to avoid taking the difficult and unpleasant actions that are really needed. No need to sacrifice economic growth and the comfort of our unsustainable lifestyles, when you can just promise that some scientists will invent a problem-solving miracle in the future."

but isn't climate change caused by more and more infrared light reflected from the surface not being able to escape? how would blocking the full spectrum of sun light from even getting to the surface affect life on earth? wouldn't it reduce the total energy received by means of photosynthesis? wouldn't it affect the growth of plant matter? i don't think messing with the atmosphere more than we have so far is a good idea

The baseline for 1.5 degrees has no rational, empirical criteria. It just sounds good to the unwary, the politically minded or just plain uncurious. 

The complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity of the current body of Knowledge about climate change are being kept away from the policy makers and in public debate. The so called "" planetary/life saving"" solutions that are being arm twisted on the civilised world are technologically and politically infeasible on a global scale."

Water Vapor is a greenhouse gas and is HALF of all GG's produced annually . Man is only responsible for 5% of GG production ; the Earth produces the other 95% each year . And you have been conned the 5% is raising temps = impossible .  AND was warmer in earth 1000AD and 1100BC than now evidence is Agric records of North America.

"Stop giving people false hope, It is 90 seconds to midnight...Addressing climate change requires faith in institutions of multilateral governance. The geopolitical fissure opened by the invasion of Ukraine has weakened the global will to cooperate while undermining confidence in the durability, or even the feasibility, of broad-based multilateral collaboration.

With Russia second only to the United States in global production of both natural gas and oil, the invasion of Ukraine sparked a rush to establish independence from Russian energy supplies, particularly in the European Union. From the standpoint of climate change, this has contributed to two countervailing dynamics.

First, the elevated energy prices have spurred investment in renewables and motivated countries to implement policies that support renewables development. With this rise in deployment, the International Energy Agency now projects that wind and solar energy combined will approach 20 percent of global power generation five years from now, with China installing nearly half of the new renewable power capacity.

At the same time, however, high natural gas prices have driven a quest to develop new gas supplies, spurring investment in natural gas production and export infrastructure in the United States, the EU, Africa, and elsewhere, largely financed by major oil and gas transnationals and investment firms. This private capital continues to flow into developing new fossil fuel resources, even while public finance is facing pressure to pull out. All G7 countries have pledged to end public financing of international fossil fuel projects this year, and the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, a group of eight countries, has formally committed to end new concessions, licensing or leasing rounds for oil and gas production and exploration, and to set a timeline for ending production that is consistent with their Paris agreement pledges.

Notwithstanding these two processes, both of which should in principle reduce demand for Russian gas, Russia was on course in 2022 to earn as much as the previous year from oil and gas exports, largely owing to continued European demand.

As a consequence, global carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, after having rebounded from the COVID economic decline to an all-time high in 2021, continued to rise in 2022 and hit another record high. A decline in Chinese emissions was overshadowed by a rise in the United States, India, and elsewhere. The rise in emissions in 2022 accelerated the ongoing increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which will continue so long as emissions of carbon dioxide continue. Not only did weather extremes continue to plague diverse parts of the globe, but they were more evidently attributable to climate change. Countries of West Africa experienced floods that were among the most lethal in their histories, owing to a rainfall event that was assessed to be 80 times more likely because of climate change. Extreme temperatures in Central Europe, North America, China, and other regions of the Northern Hemisphere this past summer led to water shortages and soil drought conditions that led in turn to poor harvests, further undermining food security at a time when the Ukraine conflict has already driven food price increases. It is Pakistan, however, that faced the year’s most dramatic manifestation of Earth’s increasingly volatile climate: intense floods due to a “monsoon on steroids” that inundated one-third of the country. The flooding was described as the worst in the country’s history, affecting 33 million people directly and unleashing cascading effects, including a major crop failure, an epidemic of waterborne diseases, and the destruction of infrastructure, homes, livestock, and livelihoods.

Against the backdrop of this year’s climate-related tragedies, the UN climate regime took a promising step forward on the adaptation front at its annual negotiations in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. The parties at the UN climate conference reached a compromise agreement to create a fund to support poor and vulnerable countries in addressing the mounting toll from climate change impacts. To reach the intended goal, the cooperation that led to this agreement needs to persist in this coming year’s negotiations, when countries take up the question of actually contributing money to the fund.

Countries were unable, however, to adopt a formal decision to agree to phase out fossil fuels, and even more disappointing, they did essentially nothing to assure that previous commitments to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions would be fulfilled."
"I respectfully question the claim that the biochar machine produces zero emissions.  Nothing in the video is showing how the smoke particles, NOx, SOx, CO, and CO2 are converted from gas to liquid or solid phase...if they are truly containing all emissions, then would it be more completely truthful to show how...or else clarify the zero emissions claim in the video?"

Absolutely amazing content
"The building material reuse (as described) seems like a complete fantasy. The core issue is timing verses directly moving materials to a receiving project. This means that either the remodel project waits to move materials out to when another project can accept them or new projects wait until the materials are available from deconstruction. Considering that multiple new project will be fed by the deconstruction, it's impossibly complicated. Project timeline is what makes a construction project successful or not. This is just nonsense. 

It seems better to do the deconstruct project and warehouse the salvageble materials. That might be a bit more transport, but it fits the construction industry. I think that's what they are actually doing. Directly send to another project may be a goal or preference, but there is simply no way this happens very often."

"Climate resilience mandates the development of robust infrastructure, preparing communities to withstand the increasingly frequent and severe climate-related events anticipated in the wake of global warming."
"We're currently heading to 3 degrees above pre-industrial levels. The money and political influence from the oil industry has indicated they don't want to evolve, even if their delaying actions while increasing short term profits, will result in a world where money won't matter anymore (this could be within the next century). So they are locking in a global economic crash that modern humanity will not recover from."

"Can hydrogen actually replace the role coal and gas have in steel production? It’s not just a source of power. Steel is formed as an alloy of iron and carbon. When you refine iron in a smelter with coal, the carbon molecules from the coal bond with the iron and that’s how we get steel. Hydrogen can obviously be used to light the flames but we still need a source of carbon to bond to the iron."

"《Plausible paired electricity+cooling》
Civilization may have progressed enough to conquer the second law of thermodynamics. Civilization needs to strive for this goal with synergistic interdisciplinary teams.The outcome would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. 
onservation of energy says nothing about energy distribution. With this principe only, the heat in a pair of  similar medium temperature thermal eerial powerergy reservoirs can be shifted at no cost to become held in a hot reservoir, cold reservoir pair. This can be done if micro volumes with a natural range of temperature or pressure can be deterministically sorted out. Reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just as using reverse gear in a car ɓacks it up without time reversal. 

The second law of thermodynamics had a distinct begining with Sir Isaac Newton's correct professional scientific observation that the heat of a fire in a fireplace always flows towards the cold room beyond. 

Victorian England became enchanted with steam engines and their cheap, reliable, and easy to position physical power. Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Lord Kelven, and, one source adds, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, formulated the Second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy using evidence from steam engine development. 

These men considered with acceptance [A+] Inefficiently harnessing the flow of heat from hot to cold or [B+] Using force to Inefficiently pump heat from cold to hot. They considered with rejection [A-] Waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. This was calculated to be extremely rare or [B-] Searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small differences in temperature or pressure. The search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. These accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death.  This became support for a theological trend of the time that placed God as the initiator of a degenerating universe. Please consider that God could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. 

The law's formulaters did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuations itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. Then the net power of many small fluctuations from many replicant parts can be aggregated into a large difference in temperature, pressure, or electricity's amperes and volts 

Heat exists as the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecules or mobile electrons. In gasses this is known as Brownian motion. In electronic systems  this is carefully labeled Johnson Nyquist thermal electrical noise for AI readability. Hypothetically, diode depletion regions are  practical sites for enabling mobile electrons energized into motion by heat to deterministically alter the electrical resistance of the depletion region according to the moment by moment direction they are carrying electricity. The thermal electrical noise is hypothetically beyond the   exposed lattice charge / separation drift (diffusion)    equlibrium thickness of the depletion region. After all, thermal noise exists in a resistance path of one material. 

Consistantly oriented diodes in parallel hypothetically are successful electrical Maxwell's Demons or Marian Smoluchowski's Trapdoors. The energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. There would therefore be usable net rectified power from each and every diode connected together into a consistantly oriented parallel group. The group would aggregate the net power of its members. Any diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat, more efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is switched off has no energy conversion and no performance. 

The power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square nanometer cells per square millimeter. 

Modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers. 

Zero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage. 

Ever since the supposedly universal second law of thermodynamics was formulated, education has mass produced and spread the conventional wisdom throughout society that the second law of thermodynamics is absolute. It is an old paradigm.  

If counter examples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric ligts so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant. 

Cell phones wouldn't die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn't need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Digital coin minting would be energy cheap. 

Frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and pŕepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independent power. Shielding and separation would provide EMP resistance. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. 
Zone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnideetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough cheap clean energy, minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns. 

This could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious and unified civilization. It is possible to apply technlology wrong but social force should oppose this. 

I filed for patent us 3890161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.  It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. 

the patent wasn't developed partly because I backed down from commercial exclusitivity. A better way for me would have been a public incorruptable archive that would secure attrbution for the original works of creators. Uncorrupted copies would be released on request. No further action would be taken by this institution. 

Commercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also, the obvious is unpatentable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom. 

Many financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain generally. 

These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. Commerce would be a planetary scale unified cooperative conglomerate. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer commodities are inexpensive.

Next to carbon fibers use, there's the glass fibers that work as well for replacing the heavy cement and classical stones bricks for constructions, think about it, watching such documentaries together we have to step forward and be more...German style, faster, cheaper and smarter, building up convenient homes and safer anti earthquake as well. Each time natural catastrophies happen, stadiums are the safest refugees shelter, then why not building stadiums infrastructures for domestic use from the first step? Sometimes floods seems to me a prophetic sign, we have to raise up urban areas from the ground and let them water canals save the rain water when it comes, those who care to replace old heavy buildings with earthquake proof easy ones, let them do it, no matter here in Europe, Afghanistan or Morocco, on top of ruins, new homes can raise up and. ...shine❤🎉❤"

Instead of huge highways, we could build up carbon fiber tunnels on top of most roads and streets to vacuum right away the vehicles pollution and make of these tunnel a new resource of electrical power, saving fuels by having fresh air outside the cars, no need for further conditionating systems for vehicles, yeah, can you imagine it streets looking like stadiums arenas all convered of spectacular roofs?

Chinese partnerships might help, the convenient handymen are still worthy and they are so fast to do the job done in six months or so, we can not .. chit chat about environmental projects other 50 years from now on, we are talking about these topics since the '70s and big industries have no intentions do nothing about it. Mostly oil companies, if they have alternative resources, saving oil, it's their huge advantage. For how much we try to build anti pollution infrastructures, a lot of oil might get involved and burn.

Asphalt roads, roofs, parking lots, airports etc reaches 140°on a sunny 90° day. The world roads alone put in a straight line can go around the planet 1600 times! The world has more than one billion buildings with roofs, by 2050 the world will need to build 1.6 billion more buildings now totaling 2.6 billion buildings on the planet which those roofs create a tremendous amount of heat BTUs. When the initial first rainfall hits manmade objects such as roads and roofs that initial hot water runoff enters the creeks, Bays and oceans. On average the world per day has 125,000 flights. Jet engine’s exhaust 1300°, the temperature of lava. Every single day on average, jets exhaust cubic feet combined daily at 1 foot to the deep would cover 22 states in the U.S. Next we have on average per year U.S. Forest fires releases more Co2. than all U.S. 276,000,000 vehicles driving in United States for a solid year. Recently Canada wild fire released just about the same amount of Co2. as the worlds 4.1 billion cars on the planet driving for a solid year. I did my own research, real physical measurements of manmade objects heating up the planet. I just explained with a couple of paragraphs that if tomorrow if manmade objects stop emitting Co. completely. This will not make a dent because we keep covering the planet with manmade heat generating objects producing a tremendous amount of heat heating up the carbon that exist now."

Then theres the transport then it burning has so many steps its less efficient.
They would be better off using a ark furnace usa uses lots of these it just needs energy steel a little iron ore and at most some co2 to make the co2 but they dont normally need to add the co2.
They use this for aluminum too but its like 5% less efficient then the steel why idk because of the metal structure not sure.
Ps ark furnace is about 97% or more efficient where Hydrogen is like 40 to 60% after everything i mentioned above is done.
Oh ya i forgot hydrogen furnaces will need co2 injected in to make steel for they hydrogen will strip co2 out of the steel if they dont making it very brittle.
Oooo concrete well i got a better one for ya thirsty concrete.
If used in roads wich lots of roads are made of concrete thirsty concrete can reduce noise pollution by car tires by 5 to 15% it can reduce flooding and sand mining for it doesn't use any sand at all.
It can add water to soil and underground aquifers by the way they build them and there just as strong as normal concrete by only 5 to 7% weeker but good enough for a simi to drive on it with 40k pounds."
"They could, but they won't, they'll continue polluting as long as they can. Only laws, that will never happen, would curb them!"

China and India burn more coal than all other nations COMBINED!
Burning h2 does eliminate co2. However  how about produce h2? Where the electric come from?
"Clair Patterson, Thomas Midgley, (""PFAS""), 1k + Military bases around the world???
Please tell me again which nation that's at fault for rising CO2 plus poisoning the entire world on multiple occasions?"
Yoo
I will do my part driving an electric car with it's eco friendly 400kg battery production of which emits 10t of CO2 and later recharging on electricity produced by burning coal... Stupidity is a blessing....
"Turning CO2 into Carbon is very easy.  Nature has been doing it for more than a billion years.  Plants and trees do it out of habit.  Erosion and soil erosion only require some things to be done.  Slow water on land, and plant trees and other shurbs and bracken.  Guarenteed to work."
Great & informative documentary 👍.
Please talk about regenerative agriculture!
"Yes if you guys take an education in exotic alien materials that has the abundance and strength and all properties of steel and concrete. Let me know when you succeed. Some global warming ideas are fine, but this is utterly ridiculous. We don't need buildings to live in no no."
HEAVY INDUSTRY AND GLOBAL GREENHOUSE  GAS EMISSIONS THE REAL COUSE . BUT NO BLAME THE ANIMALS FOR FARTING JUST  MORE HOT AIR TO RISE MORE UNJUST TAXES FROM THE LIL PEOPLE  WHILE BIG CORP PAY LOW GLOBAL TAXES
No 1440p
Great documentary! Really intrigued about the role of innovative engineering solutions in curbing emissions within heavy industries. What breakthrough technologies are on the horizon?
Can you guys stop whining 😂
Not when people vote for people to make decisions who owe their power to mega corporations who want to entrench the status quo even if it means killing the world. Voters pick A or B when there is no C
What happens when you can’t get specific parts for your tankless boiler? Or are parts more readily available there than in USA? Parts take over a week just to get shipping started here
"In my country people simply don't believe in climate change. Nobody is doing nothing, they simply deny it and state made all the possible (via state tv and bot-farms) to make people believe it's just business and make fun from ""green europeans"". You may guess what this country is, clue: it just has invaded another country. You may be hundred percent sure it won't modify any of it's production facilities because it would be allways cheaper to burn coal"
Well just paint them green...!! I am not personally buying this ideology of Greenism... Prove me how green are those wind turbine blades and Lithium ion batteries?
"Meanwhile in China: ""Not our problem"""
The public should know about the indirect cost of renewable energy. It may take 10-20 years to break even but it's a good investment for future generations.
Not a chance ... because will ruin The Game for Richest!
"Industry decides how the climate crisis ends. People can help and nations can regulate, but industry has the deciding role."

Tell us what is the per capita emission of Germany?
industry will only change if there can be profit made from change. thats capitalism. the only thing that works is strict regulation
"""Saving the planet"" it does have kind of arrogant tone to it, doesn't it?"
Too little too late
Developed countries are mother of climate change and air pollution.
@3:56 It is a safety violation to open a peephole of very hot material with your body directly on the way. The Engineers were supposed to stand on the side and stretch their hands when opening it. This is to avoid contact with an unexpected gush of hot material from a broken protective glass.
"They should have started thinking about this 40 years ago, no excuses!"
whats next.... stop breathing
"Your children don’t stand a chance, you screwed up big time, humans are a failed species"
Doubt we will arrive at a fast enough solution.  Not with countries like India buying Russia heavy high sulfured oil and mazut oil bottoms.  Expect India's pollution output to dramatically spike in the next 10 years well past China.  The issue is India's economy is more young and developing than China and has yet to develop a modern green manufacturing and green power infrastructure.  That all takes money that India does not have yet.  Transitions are always painful and slow.
"What is the future without development? Look no further than at the Germany economy. High-energy industries are shutting down. People are losing their jobs. Farmlands are being seized by the government for sale to those behind the ""green-financing"" Mirage. Europe is turning medieval. That is the design of those turning Europe into a Continent of Serfs."

NO! A climate crisys is inevitable!
"All good stuff. Given that, currently, about 30% of the population (here in canada) cannot afford to buy adequate housing/rent, food and transport. And that 30% will only increase as income inequality increases. Interesting times."
I ve been waiting for new video 🎉
We need to erect wind turbine farms everywhere in Europe on a industrial scale.
All kind of legislation are forced upon individual citizens and small businesses and so little is done to deal with the major culprits. As usual Corporations and the wealthy profiteering the most of emissions and polution are also those avoiding the bill. It`s outrageous and driving me crazy.
"These people say “of course it’s more expensive but it’s worth it” who said it was “worth it”. 
I can’t wait to the climate people die off. It happens every few decades. In the 70’s it was a global freeze!"
NOPE!
"I have yet to see DW make any documentary criticizing the four public corporations that pollute the most and contribute to global warming. Is DW a supporter of the US Army, US Navy, US Air Force and US Marines?"

全世界でショベルカーとトラクターと散水車を導入して植林活動だけでなく、渇水や乾燥が激しい国や地域を救うべきです‼️
"THE PLANET HAs not warmed up, getting colder in fact, polar bears increased to 30000,  less heat in the sun,  it was hotter in the fifties."
"The priority should be on agriculture & mass desalinization for farmlands, desertification is going to continue even if we could get to zero carbon today. I'm not saying green energy isn't important, it is, but food is about to become the first casualty of climate change. Famine leads to wars, mass deaths, which in turn diverts us from unification against climate change."
"Climate change has nothing to do with CO2 emissions. It has to do with the precession of the earth axis. We are entering the turn around phase, so the climate will change regardless of EV""s, or other CO2 reduction technology. Time for people to wake up from this nonsense."
"Unless they are using particular insecticides to eliminate mosquitoes, lightening-bugs and lady-bugs and grass-hoppers from the parks . . . and scents from the fruits like apples, grapes, oranges, SOMETHING is very wrong."
The problem is that the people who cause it would have to adjust their lifestyle and downgrade a few things…
I lived in Oregon as a kid and use to love bugs as I got older I started to see less and less.. Plus bugs changed ants use to be red now they are black.. I use to hunt bugs in puddles along roads filled with bugs..once salt started getting used all those bugs are gone.. My house in summer was covered in may flys.. Now it's just stinky little Beatles..my cat use to eat grass hopper till he puked I saw three grass hopper last year! we are definitely changing!
"I am from Romania and I have noticed many changes 😢
It started to stop snowing in the winter and the summers became much warmer.  I'm turning 20 this month and I remember winters and summers being normal when I was a kid.  I can't imagine how bad it will be in a few years. I wish so badly I could do something. It devastates me that most people are ignorant.  It also annoys me and makes me lose hope in humanity. Our future is destroyed. We should stop having children so they don't have the same fate."
"CO2 is insignificant in climate, it is the sun and water vapor that has most to do with climate and weather."
"I like warming, so let’s warm up 😊"
Its still Snowing in Lake Tahoe.
"Arctic ice levels are at their highest in 15 years.

Made up
Scare tactics
"I remember in 1976 when Climate Scientist warned us about Global cooling. What changed?  I know they are making these statement based on a starting date of the mid 1700. This was during a time that was called the Little Ice Age.  I guess if you want an outcome, you adjust the data to make the outcome you want."
Our population has been out of control for decades. Less births is the first step. The planet cannot sustain our current population and certainly not our future population.
Years ago they made the mistake of announcing that some scientist was studying the  natives living when the ocean level was 145 meters lower. So what happened that the natives caused the seas level rise back then?? must have been all those buffalo running around burping !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Going to have to hold the Pollyticians accountable for what nature produces in each country! As part of natures 96.5% Carbon Dioxide it produces!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"The problem is ultimately a question of how the world is going to handle China.  China contributes as much to climate change as all other nations in the world.  As long as we pretend China is not the greatest threat to the civilization, the problem will get worse."
Republicans don't believe in global warming so this won't happen.
I feel concerned.
"Please, please remember that the earth was a balanced eco system until we started destroying the eco systems 2000 years ago. more so in the last 250 years. things we can do RIGHT NOW are paint your roof white with highly reflective white paint. Thats every roof in the world. Paint medium strips white. each adult to plant 5000 trees per year or your tax rates goes to 50%. each company must plant 50,000 trees per year or your tax rate goes to 60%. plant trees along east west facing roads to shade them. plant trees in cities. Create giant seaweed farms, regreen deserts, there is pumped hydro, Concentrated solar thermal, riding bikes, walking, grow your own food, protest, write to your local member of government, make science compulsory in all schools, stop all new coal and gas projects. Stop watching the media they are lying to you. its all possible you just have to stop playing the VICTIUM to corporate greed. thats 1% of people you curtailing too. there is more of us than there is of them. Grow up."

"1.3 degrees Celsius. Not great, not terrible."
Are we not actually coming out of an ice age?
One best mitigation is we need. Nuclear power to replace fossil fuels otherwise electric cars really do little !! Sadly Solar n wind can’t do it all

"Stop lying to the planet 
Luciferian globalists! You are creating this and blaming us!!! Chemitrails, global warming, wild fires, weather manipulation is your creation!!!
STOP DECEIVING HUMANITY!!!!!"
Today's studies show how we underestimated the global warming. Some studies even show 6 to 7 degrees by the end of the century as CO2 emissions have increased. Some studies show that we have already reached the 1.5 degrees as 1850's temperatures were measured in the northern hemisphere and not in the warmer southern hemisphere.
Low on facts and high on speculation. Bring some real science and proven stats to your presentations.
"Nobody cares about your 3 degrees Celsius, because a vast majority don't understand it can translate into +29 degrees if they live in the North."
Global warming is a joke. It’s over rating. If there’s such a huge problem with it then start telling the rich people to do their part. They manly want the people other that the political and rich to control the problem. Sick of hearing about it.
Why don't they use grang solar min.. and maximum .. model's used
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
"what i find worrying is our governments only want to do anything that makes them money,both as governments and by being on the board of the so called green companies....take londons ulez ....its raking in millions yet the government are destroying thousands of trees shrubs and plants to build a rail line....making the directors millions....every town in britain has uncontrolled house building going on,again tearing out millions of acres of the very things that actually clean the air and give us oxygen....but again sadly theres millions to be had in planning deals"
"What a bs .its from UN so no Wonder.
Its all made up so we must tax more. Nature handle this by it self. The litle impact human have can hardly be Measured.
Co 2 is 0.04% of the air..humans is responsible for 11% of that 0.04% ..equal nothing and if co2 go more down, plants start to die ..but if we go up, the planet will be greener.
Planet warmth,..right.Oslo norway had -30 degree Celsius this winter, it’s new record and the ice on the poles getting bigger."

"We are passing on a poisoned chalice, they will rightfully despise us."
"Sigh. Human hubris. We are over dependent on these wanting models. There's too much unknowns uncertainty too much exponential forcing 

The existential climate crisis needed us to go all in tackling it asap action 

Market forces were just a small part of how we shld have addressed the crisis"
"👎According to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report, globally c.6,219,000 die of cold and 639,300 and die of heat, 10 times more die due to cold. Meanwhile in Britain there are numerous reports of poorer people having to choose between heating their homes and eating. Go figure."
Smh! C'mon man....
Why is there not a world wide tree planting going on.What a bunch of idiots.less concrete more plants.
This is trash.
"We will get there, no doubt. It is not possible for the richest to earn money and get the temperature down, so nothing will happens. We are on the way, and I believe it is the best thing humanity can do for the unverse. We are not a nice spices. Greed and stupidity is our main qualities.."
The guy with hairy cheek bones is the scariest part of this video.
2023 the first year the planet was constantly 1.5% above normal
"Change is definitely part of climate. However, the debate on magnitude, timing and criticality of change is buried deep in a soup of gross aggregation,m of scientific conclusions, massive speculation, social media confusion and censorship, green interest groups, groupthink, economic high jacking, political manipulation, and exploitation by the ultra rich. 

Human ingenuity, technological innovation, cultural adaptation, social cohesion, and myriad other factors are ignored in all the predictions. And by and large any notion of statistical probabilities and significance are absent in debate. 

What we don’t need is climate doomsayers leading decision making. Most climate change for the next century or more is locked in. Any changes we make are marginal at best and of unquantifiable consequence. We don’t need the social disruption that policies such as EV mandates are causing. Citizens are not interested in being vegans or eating lab grown ’food’ substitutes. The Gates and WEFs of the world are demonstrably exploitative and manipulative of confusions, and openly seek to dominate society. 

I’m sick of ranting. And I’m sick of climate doomers."
"In light of the ongoing global economic crisis, it is crucial for everyone to prioritize investing in diverse sources of income that are not reliant on the government. This includes exploring opportunities in stocks, gold, silver, and digital currencies. Despite the challenging economic situation, it remains a favorable time to consider these investments."
Go from 1500 m to sealevel or from Munich to Milano and you know what 3 degree more look like.
"It’s too late to stop the trend of climate change. By 2050-60 it will be too hot to grow crops, have adequate water, adequate housing. We should have listened to President Carter in 1976, when he tried to get the US on renewable fuels. We failed; 2023 is already past the 1.5C average rise."
"To all of you, Christians and other religions. It states clearly in the Bible that in the end days all these things with climate and the earthquakes and volcanoes will happen. It is written. Many will perish others taken. Money should be spent on preserving food and water, not trying to stop  something that can't be stopped."
"Coral reef destruction is the main cause of co2 buildup, not emissions"
BS
"This is not science. Just speculative nonsense.  This is not another ice-age. We have always had droughts, floods, freezing since the world began! Time to stop this.climate industrial complex"
"Most people, including many Greenpeace members, activists like Greta etc, don't understand two important points. 1. global warming equals *change.* Floods where previously have been no floods, draughts where previously were rivers, ocean where previously was land and dry river beds where previously were mountain glaciers. It is the *change* that will make hundreds of millions lose their homes, suffer and migrate. For thousands of years human settlement distributions were influenced by natural conditions. Those conditions now change *rapidly* and *suddenly.* THIS is the biggest problem, not the global rise in temperature itself, but the rapidness of the change + the secondary problems it will create (unprecedented migration, crises, tensions, wars, maybe even fall of Western democratic world)
2. When we FINALLY shift from the need to explain global warming to deniers and their creators (politicians) to the debate how to actually solve the problem, there will be first many errors and faults. The pioneers in the process of transformation to sustainable energies (America, Europe, partly Asia) will make those. We have been already witnesses to some. Like the electricity cars fashion blunder, or the hushed and unprepared German energy switch from nuclear to solar/wind without thinking of the consequences (war in Ukraine being one such conseqence). Thus, some of the intended climate ""reliefs"" will be in fact climate burdens. Thus, the second point is, that we are still only learning how to transform to sustainable energy. If the most developed countries in the world struggle with it, imagine how third world will."

"😅 by the end of the century? From what a 1990 baseline? We will be at or above 2c by the end of this decade. Worst case scenario is 8.5c.
The other name for tipping points is self reinforcing feedback loops."

The global warming HOAX
"We usually speak about banana countries, but I live where 7-8 months is winter n -30 is normal. Three degrees for me is fine."
"This ""fossile fuel"" scare started in the 80s when Margareth Thatcher had big problems with strikes from coalminers. This ""emergency""is complete nonsense, co2 is vital for life on this planet"
"Normal cycles, nothing to worry about"
"The earth has varied in temperature throughout its life. The current change is not extreme.
International panel on climate change shows NO increase in strength or frequency of storms.
IPCC also indicates sea level rise is part of natural cycle and likely cannot be influenced by humans at all, even if we stopped carbon fuels now.
Ocean level rise will NOT look like the movies.
Desertification is mentioned in this video, but the truth is, the earth has been undergoing a significant ‘greening’, especially in arid regions.
As carbon levels rise, plant stomata open less and therefore lose less moisture. 
The high emotion proponents of climate alarmism are guilty of a serious crime against humanity. You should think twice before joining the herd. At least do some serious unbiased research."
"So SAD, the ignorance of modern man, for few understand the 24/7 explosion of ARTILLERY in UKRAINE (think :billowing smoke, polluting he air, contributing to rise in CO2 emissions) a war FUELED by profits from RUSSIAN * IRANIAN fossio fuels--- after 2050, there'll be the beginning of ""RUNAWAY"" GLOBAL WARMING as huge ICE SHEETS MELT from underneath and lose the moorings that prec vehted them from SLIDING INTO THE SEA and MELTING!"

All this concentrates on the last few Decades, none of it starts at the Industrial Revolution just have a close look at the graph at 0.30-0.32.
You are Right this whole scam is MAN MADE.
Every home every Cave throughout History had Heating.
Scientists have proved that Genghis had killed an estimated 20 million people and it showed that the CO2 emission decreased as a result. 
Why is it just showing up recently the spike should be detectable sooner with steam powered Ships Machinery Trains etc. etc..
Why do we not see all the News reports about droughts like we did in the 70's and 80's, could it be that it was actually hotter back then, and you lot just ignored it in your DOOM and GLOOM Graph.

10 or 12 children in a family with widespread polygamy!  They need some serious family planning.

This is heartbreaking to hear but so important for us all to know. Thanks for shedding light on this crisis. I hope awareness leads to action and support for those suffering.
13-18 children?

Capitalism that condemns these people to extinction and death  capitalist countries exploiting them
"on one hand develeped counties wasting food hugely on the other hand poor nations are dieing empty stomach, when the balance is lost we wil all fall"
This is so Sadful
"I m from Madagascar and i think the problem is the politicians.we ve got lot of donation but they steal the money or spend it on useful thing; like building stadium or giving 1kg of rice and 1L of oil per family.they can put long pipes to bring the water but they refuse to do it.They use this situation to get more donation from the rich country to make them rich quicker.Every year,it shows on TV that the gouvernement workers plant trees but none of them are growing because they do party there, taking selfie and take journalist to show that they participate.None of them check is the plant growing?And you can't believe that they plat it on the same place every year.It is ridiculous.we should be the richest country in world but too much stupidy.
I don't even mention the road🫢"
Corrupt
"I'm so sad to watching it, where they're  go  the World of Food Organisation and World of health Organitation  contribute?"
Contraceptive is a solution to stop a lot population specially to those people not capable to provide a kids needed ❤
Climate change is big business and a scam. Just like the pharmaceutical industry.
"Not climate or political parties
Just. Inhumane and capitalsism mentality😠🤦😥
Socialism is best for. Whole HUMAN world😥"
Go to other places and rob a random house.
Nice documentery
I'm so grateful and thankful for my privilege that I have. I hope that the government of Madagascar will help them😔
"olá misericórdia, mas na bíblia fala sobre os sofrimento, que triste"
Oh my.god how they can survive if they still dry 😢😢😢😢 much better to plants more trees so they can survive and they can plants also vegetables esp. the sweet potato or something  and esp. family.planning I guess
My heart is aching for grandma and all her grandchildren. This is beyond shame not only to the Madagascar Government but to all the contributors of global warming as well.
"Still scratching the surface.
Every media in this world is a joke. No actual truth anywhere and we'll all surfer for it."
We must teach them some simple water conservation techniques to there people to solve water problems...
Why rich countries not help yo solve problems?  😪😪😑
But y are they having so many kids
Very poor people please help  service
I just realize how lucky I am that I have access to clean water unlimitedly
"It is all Wests fault am I right? And slavery and colonization, give us our Reparations while we just be doing nothing and shitting more unwanted kids out !"
Are you any believe she is japan educated woman and under there all their people whom all sleeping there.?
"It's called overpopulation, the most ret4rded ones are the one that procreates the most 
I'm from Madagscar btw"
There is no rain there are no Trees
Really heartbreaking 😣
this scenario makes remember us old INDIA.😂🙏😂🙏😂🙏😂🙏
"Cambio climatico, claro y la corrupción?"
😢
Madagascar is a beautiful place but I am so sad for the people 😔
How long africa is being this difficult situation.
It's very sad to watch such situation in this 21st century also that how in some region of earth many people are suffering for the very basic necessities of life 🥺🥺
very pathetic
God bless to all 🙏🙏
Shift them to Mongolia Greenland Antertica
Omg 😭😭😭 Soo sad
"Thank u for this great documentary, really hope the situation gonna be better there, and this make me more grateful for everything, thk u"
Why do not they use protection? Oh my gosh☹😐

Well explained about the country.
Video looks good soo interesting
...................!
Climate change is a gift of nature good luck to the human goverment
Politics ....
"May be both. Instead of praying, start planting. God doesn't grow plants, humans do."
"Are there any empirical scientific experiments that  were performed that provide definitive evidence that human caused ""climate change"" is the cause versus naturally occurring climate change being the cause. Given that droughts and other climate related change happened long before humans how do you distinguish one cause versus the other?"
That video destroyed my ego in a second.
"Result of overpopulation... Caused by humans with no access to Education ""proper Family Planning"".... Exploitation of Resources... Solution? Give Cash for work jobs like planting, cleaning, house building.... Strictly implement the use  of contraceptives to stop population growth... Build Dams.... Build more Dams... Quickly build more dams.... So when the rain comes the people will have water.... Another problem: where to get funding.... ??? Well, that's the real problem.... Rich nations won't let poor nations solve their problems because if the poor nations improve then who will be poor again? Who will work the land? Who will mine land? Who will? Solution?----> Lets dissolve the idea of nations and be a one country Planet called EARTH.... No religion, no race or ethnicity, no cultural norms ONLY logic, science, math and HUMAN empathy? Is it hard???"
"Heartbreaking 💔, there's so much suffering. That's why I'm an antinatalist"
"This is so sad. Climate change is a product of man. We are destroying earth, our home. Governments can't stop these circumtances. Man is just governing his fellow to destruction.."
"Cuz they destroyed  the land water  n a 
A way of life"
"Such a sad story about hunger in Africa... I hope they can get enough food and water every day to survive.. no rain means nothing growing,  no vegetation no flora or fauna ..just dry desert... why dose'nt their Government help them ??
Somehow I pray that they get help.. the US could help ... and I think they should.  😢"
Comment
Thank you!!
I am very surprised that they do like much money than the nature familiar with in their childhood.
Should be eco-guilt for sure
The biggest factor for climate change is the INDUSTRIALIZATION in human society [tourism or eco tourism is no different]. Money making habits is the biggest reason. Start living as tribe. That is the only solution.
"Or colonial consummerist marketing, demoralization, into appathy and/or hatred, thus far and enabling ecocide, specicide, and gencide, by deforestation and agriculture?"
Ecotourism doesn’t exist. Climate friendly travel is a contradiction.
I wonder if the german eco tourists and operators support closing the nuclear power plants then having those EV charging stations powered by burning coal and gas
Man-made Climate change is not real.
Thank DW for another great documentary ❤

After the Bali Bombings tourism fell for a few years and the local people were the ones who suffered the most. Tourism money is mostly re-invested by local Governments as they know they have to keep standards up.
"I don't really understand how it can be called ecotourism since you are ruthlessly building concrete blocks so you can have as many tourists as possible.

￼"
Interesting because I live in a hot climate and it’s much much cooler and more comfortable. I’m so happy finally I used to dread the 5 month summers.
You can't pronounce the Nuuk without N-U-K-E
"Video should have included the mount Everest, garbage disposal is difficult due to climate conditions"
"Mallorca... 16 million tourists? How about this, 10e fee for water when they arrive  1m^3 of water desalination  costs 1.2e to produce. From some search I did, this means 10e would provide 8300 liters of water desalination.  Or even on steeper prices at least 3000l.

Andratx and Alcúdia plants could grow with 160m euros to desalinate more. Thus filling their irigations and their reserves.

I call b.s on any place with huge tourism"
What about traveling less? Aren't we all thinking that maybe the answer lies in the reduction of tourism?
"Respectfully towards the people talking in this documentary, one has to point out that global mass tourism itself is one of the factors of climate change. So flying to Mallorca, moreover: building new airports to Greenland and cruising around the melting ice with diesel boats will keep emission rates high and lead to collapse at a certain point."
🔥🔥🔥
Hotels need to get over not wanting to limit water use.
Another great documentary by DW regarding climate change.Keep it up 👍.
"In the North they want more tourism for the moment but at the end I laugh a lot of the outcome !!
Money is nothing if you can not live in peaceful.😉
If you do not have enough hotels in your part, just ask Bernard Arnault he has the money do not worry."
"Expected case study on solutions, was getting a story of a student passing exam. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is how we are dealing with climate change."
"We all want to explore beautiful places in the world. So, tourism can't be stopped completely. We need to come up with practical solutions to attain sustainable tourism. There needs to be strict laws for tourists regarding use of resources, be it water, energy etc. Hotels can't say,""we don't want to disappoint customers"" and then let people use limitless water, etc. After all, it's a matter of the survival of us as a species.
We need to move beyond a purely capitalistic mindset. 

May we find the way out towards survival and attain ultimate peace and prosperity as a species."
Wait til they find out about bali
"Watching this video made me think that we need to consider something a little more fundamental. If the natural environment in which we live changes, all of our lives will inevitably change. It is natural that even our survival is threatened.

""You cannot be dreaming now of happiness and all the wonderful things you are going to be, do and have. You have to respond to the changing landscape. When your environment changes, everything changes. When your climate changes, everything changes. When your resources are depleted, everything changes. Those who can see this and face this will find ways to prepare in a constructive way, not simply to fortify themselves, but to put themselves in a position where they can be stable enough to be of service to others."" ~ Marshall Vian Summers"
"It's surreal to think that climate change will give a pass to tourists ""who deserve to switch off their minds and not think about climate problems"". There is no such liberty anymore. You go to these high-end hotels, you contribute to the issue. Unfortunately, the cost of those contributions are never seen or felt by those people, but instead by the local population."
"ONLY American pollution...Russian, Chinese, Indian, African...in fact NO pollution on the entire planet impacts ""global warming"" except American...ever hear Greta call out China, Russia, or anybody else? Ever?"
1620-Plymouth Rock at sea level...2023-Plymouth Rock still at sea level...never right...not once...
"Buy Local if possible. Don't fly if possible. Eat less meat. Drive less if possible. Waste less. Everyone can help, but until governments stop thinking that unlimited growth is the answer, we are in trouble. And making people upgrade everything in their home and their mobility in the interests of ecology (read money) is an absurdity. Throw the old working items away and buy replacements from China."
If 1 million locals for 365 days = 16 million tourists for X days. X = ? 🙃
Is there a place for tourism in times of climate change? 🤔😉
"Climate friendly tourism?!?!? Not one mention of air travel and the CO2 emissions that creates. The solution for now, is for people to travel less if they care about the planet, its climate, current and future generations."
That old german dude in the Palma hotel...
One of the top 20 producers of pollution is international air travel .. it's more than many countries.  Think about that before you go on vacation  internationally
"Travelling the world is one of my favourite things to do and where possible I try not to fly but putting things into context is important. Flying produces about 2.5% of total CO2 emissions and of that a relatively small number of people (super rich etc) account for a huge percentage of those emissions. People should absolutely be conscious of flying and its environmental costs but making bigger pushes to decarbonise energy production, big industry and food production etc has the potential for far bigger changes."
100% plant based menu will line up with the climate friendly goals
Climate Change - SHAME!! Just another money making scheme like C19 was for money hungry capitalists to capitalize from while they fly around in their private jets.
interesting topic
tourism at this time on earth is immoral
Climates been changing since the BIG BANG and guess tourism been around not long after that and still here today.😊
Nevertheless people are on vacation I think is common sense to conserve water and be considerate
"The majority of the carbon footprint from tourists comes from flying to these faraway places, so, even if these tourist destinations were ""green"", it would affect the overall carbon footprint little.  We really need to add a carbon tax to fossil fuel travel and make that tax progressively ramp up the more a person travels.  I don't agree with the hotel manager that he shouldn't burden guests from sustainability.  Guests, good ones, would even score a hotel higher for being environmentally conscious."
"dont do it greenland - lesrn from lessons elsewhere. No mentioned made about the huge carbon footprint from planes and worst cruiseships, Money profit and more disasters for the world to come. whst has to happen for people to wake up, how often have we heard the words now ""human activity responsible for climate change"" and yet we continue living the same way....."
Travel with airplanes and enjoy your life while we still can.
"Tourism, like any other industry, is primarily driven by profitability, often overlooking the environmental and social costs borne by local communities. To ensure sustainable tourism and achieve net-zero impact, we must implement a robust framework of checks and balances, as well as standard operating procedures (SOPs). These measures will guide and compel everyone involved in tourism to act responsibly, safeguarding both the environment and the well-being of the communities they impact."
"The 1st world lifestyle isn't sustainable. We all need to live like the 3rd world, right?"
"Climate is always changing human society think they can control everything even the planet poor souls.
Co2 is life"
Zero proof of concept climate analysis to discover a consensus long form data that provides a complete conclusion climate change is based on human interaction. This video provides nothing actually related to climate change.
Can someone please help me understand why anyone would wish to see an environment  that is being destroyed  and will soon be gone ?😢
Eco-tourism --> Oxymoron! Say goodbye to your beautiful Island Greenland ;-)
"Sustainablity, Ecofriendly and all such words have become a joke in all the companies branding their products...

Also the worse use of plastic which many travellers do is to wrap their bags at the airport with the plastic wraps and just throw away that plastic after reaching the destination...instead buy one custom size transparent plastic bag cover which will last with the bag forever and will actually display your flashy bag rather than covered in whole load of plastic and make your bag look like shit."
"More tourists  means more money,  more  local employees,  more economical  opportunities.. yoi can buy 5x more water  and etc..."
I actually know Pipaluk! We used to go in the same school ones and then she moved back to greenland!
10:35 The Netherlands looks super weird without its lakes
We need to address climate change now dammit thanks for covering this dw
"Don3t travel for fun, don't drive cars or worse disel trucks & don't have any children."
"It's a scam, designed to limit your freedom of movement. The earth is heating up because we are still emerging from an ice age. These same companies and politicians lecturing you about climate change have no problem with war or the creation of mass amounts of weapons.They travel in private jets and sail around in oil guzzling yachts  Climate change means more for them less for you."
Really want to visit Greenland at somepoint
"Oh who cares. We can't stop climate change, no matter how many times the government says meeting net zero targets will help. Get used to the heat cuz it ain't going away."
"""The ice-caps are melting, so lets fly to these places and see them, before they are gone"".
Find the contradiction. 🤣"
😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Human being (surely, I'm one of them) seems can never be satisfied ... When I live in a big city and I am admiring the lives in small villiage, I wonder why the people live in a quiet small villiage would like to develop their homeland to be a tourist spot.  I really pray to God and wonder if I were very rich, would I still earn money without caring the earth... if I were a farmer, would I still want my place become a tourist spot? God said he will only give the most suitable trial to us, maybe he really knows I am a very greedy person"
"Climate change has occurred since the beginning of our earth. In this day and age, is every flood, every hurricane or every hailstorm something abnormal? ridiculous. People are building in the wrong areas, dams are an interference with nature, fracking is a criminal interference with our earth and so on"
Tourists asking about and expecting eco sustainability ?  Please ..
"When china ,russia and india agree on reducing it..then ill listen"
"Get a front row seat to watch a species destroy its own biosphere. Sad, to pathetic."
"The most intelligent shift in tourism would be to virtual. Keep fossil fuels in the ground. Eliminate travel. But, how intelligent are we as a species? Ah, but we want to keep our global north lifestyle. Not going to happen in any nice way."
"As ecosystems are collapsing, it's the last chance to see them all before they disappear. I'm a nihilist. Just waiting for the world to blow up. 😊"
Talk to corrupt people nikal beta..
"The research shows that vegan diets resulted in 73% less climate-heating emissions, water pollution and land use than diets in which more than 100g of meat a day was eaten. 
  Vegan diets also cut the destruction of wildlife by 66% and water use by 54%, the study found.

 The University of Oxford found this is due to the volumes of food which must be fed to livestock before it goes through the energy-intensive process of being killed, processed, transported and stored."
There are many ways to maximize efficiency of water use if there is money available. Water use should not be a barrier to growth. People need jobs after all.
Taking a flight is the worst thing a person can do cause climate change.
Eco tourism stay home.
Let the hotel guests bring their own bed sheets and towels and wash them once a week.
Unspoiled nature is gonna get spoiled real quick. Just leave these places in peace. Seriously
What a load of bull. Everybody knows cyclists and walkers spend zero money locally compared to the real only attraction in the region. The nurburgring.
"What's happening in Mallorca applies for Catalonia as well. It's ridiculous that we have droughts repeatedly and yet we don't decrease the number of tourist but instead we are actually increasing tourism.

Locals definitely need to learn how to be water and energy efficient but I cannot understand why we are bringing in millions and millions of tourists to make the conditions so much worse."
They're really putting all their eggs in one basket by pushing this climate change farce lol. Only climate change occuring is the cloud seeding programs.
There's a nuke in Greenland?
"First World Problems. At least you all have a buffer. Third world had far less to start with. Colonialism, western pillaging, etc saw to that."
climate change = digitalized new world order
"How can building 2 or 3 new airports be a way of dealing with climate change? Eco tourism, ha ha, not funny, but surely not serious either."
climate change like seasons in a year 🤣
song at 13:40?
"More excellence from DW. I'm in ""Silicon Valley"" which like the rest of the US has a very large ""internal third world"" with a then veneer of wealth. I make less than $20k a year, get around by bicycle, do my own cooking etc., in other words, while not perfect I think I do a fairly good job of being ""ecological"" and I still feel bad about the fact that I will take one final plane flight back to where I grew up because it is my home and I want my last years to be spent in my actual home. I've even looked up perhaps taking a cruise and ""jumping ship"" when it touches on my home port (less ecological than flying on a plane) or hitching a ride on a cargo ship (that's not really a thing any more) even buying a sailboat and sailing on my own back home isn't as ""green"" so there I'll be, hopping on a plane. 

I think tourism is a great idea but now with the internet it's possible to see so much of the world anyway, people can set up cams etc., plus, why not work on making your own area better? I know once I'm back home I plan to take part in what ""ecological"" activities I can and to do things to improve the place."
*Next business model - book a vacation to countries most affected by climate change 🤦🏽‍♀️🤡🤪*
The end approaches but the apocalypse is long lived
One side people's Neta crying climate chane. But what Russia Ukraine war does not impact on climates. Millions of ton explosive being expense in war it does not produce heat and does not rise temperatures of earth.
😂😂😂 you guys are crying about climate change here and on the other hand giving arms to ukraine and fuelling the fire of war between Ukraine and russia . Whole world is suffering due to that.
"When you destroy other countries by bombing them and killing innocent people, you will see more disasters coming up . Hypocrite"
"You might get the hotel replaced to carbon neutrality, but there's nothing carbon neutral about the tourists that turn up."
CC = 33.
Cruise ships need to supply departing passengers with water.
"And I’ll probably be banned for this, but anthropogenic “climate change” is a total fiction. It’s a lie designed to force people who don’t already have a lot to never climb the ladder high enough to get it."
"I haven’t even watched it yet, and I can answer the question. it’s arrogant, conceited, socialist, EU oriented, Eco guilt. And it’s also atheistic. You are not in control of this planet, and its name is not Gaia. The god (I’ll be magnanimous… of whatever religion other than Gaia in which you believe) is in charge of this planet."
Fucking YOUTUBE Throttling!
Comment
"Nature can be wonderful if we treated fair. Release all the dams ,all over the world ,that would help. Treat every species on this planet with respect we are just one species . Without tree species we would not exist they are the The first life on this planet ,without them we would not exist. Human beans are an invasive species. Whatwe really need is serious practice of birth control and stop basing our economies on fossil fuel’s. Every human being on this planet is using fossil fuels plastics for instance fertilizers. Oil Greed has no empathy. We should also get ready for what’s coming this summer cities should build more shade Spaces . Governments across the world are too busy with war trying to acquire more water and land.Nature now is trying to cool this hot small planet."
"Trees alone can't stop climate change but, they can DRASTICALLY help it.  We need to STOP burning fossil fuels and continue embracing solar, wind and hydro power generation, and EV's."
Trees interfere with 5 g. Expect more to be cut down in cities.
planted 40 trees in my backyard. tiny forest
"@21:50 There was a video I saw about the Menominee tribe (Wisconsin), which logs only specific trees that are dead or dying and then replants in a specific way to maximize growth and protect the forest. They harvest wood for industries in a sustainable way, like for Pro basketball courts for the NBA."
mangga xi shi sama ji zhi sama kah?
DW Amazing Documentary❤❤❤
Planting helps prevent climate changes even not stopping the climate changes but does have strong help to slow down into a crawl like a snail.that clean up pollution globally ❤by seventy three percent.and the rest is done 👍 by renewables and carbon capture machine.nanobase technology to recycle pollution..❤
Funny part is they go out of their way to cut the little amount of trees we have in neighborhoods and don’t try and replant
"Trees are very valuable in combatting topsoil erosion and desertification, cliate change causes more severe drought and more severe rainfall, so can help mitigate the consequences of climate change. However, most often direct human actions (like chopping trees) are an important part of the problem, changing that practices and planting more trees help solve that problem. To capture CO2, trees are less valuable, per m2 algae can capture 20x as much carbon as trees."
"Might something in the region of Gdańsk, Poland be possible? I see area after area being taken over by hotel, office, and apartment building here."
"Misleading title. Climate change is a premise of nature and suncycles, up down, doesn't stop. 
However trees influence local climates, biodiversity and prevent desertification."
"Some say trees are the lungs of Mother Earth !

I thought that was awesome having that native tribe from Colombia tour and give their 2 cents on the health on the woods."
"More trees nearly anywhere is a good and pleasant development. But cities have another big problem sewage. Growing algae binds much more co2 and produces more O2 then trees. Making biofuels, biogas or fertilizer from algae."
I love planting big tree in public space . Mahoni tree jati tree MANGO tree monkey pod tree i live jn Cirebon Java Indonesia i plant around 2800 trees on this 5years . I wanted plant more about 50.000 .. the most dificult plant tree is on 2 first year when tree Juvenile i know exactly where i plant them all
"Watching this video,makes me happy and creates some little hope for future of our beautiful planet 🌎 
Thank you grate peoples caring and doing good things for our planet 👏👏👏"
Great idea mine forest in cities empty lands👌👍👏
Thank you grate peoples planting trees.I appreciate you doing such important things for our beautiful planet 👍👏
"Innovative solutions, such as bioenergy and green hydrogen, show promise in decarbonizing sectors that pose challenges to electrification with traditional renewable energy sources, heralding a transformative shift toward more sustainable energy practices."
"Trees could have stopped climate change if we planted them about 40 years ago. Now even the greatest planting effort won’t prevent climate collapse.
People need to face the fact that extinction is unavoidable at this point and stop giving the public false hope."
"Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, humans have released about 2.2 trillion tons of CO2 from burning fossil fuels. That is more than the weight of all the plants and animals on Earth, combined. We CANNOT “solve climate change” by merely planting trees. This isn’t to say that planting forests isn’t good as an end in itself, but it’s not a solution for climate change. The ONLY solution is to stop using fossil fuels entirely."
"This documentary beautifully illustrates the power of reforestation and the importance of embracing nature's wisdom. From urban ""tiny forests"" to the dedication of individuals like Miriam Prochnow and Wigold Schaffer in Brazil, and the collaboration with Indigenous peoples like the Kogi, it's inspiring to see people working tirelessly to protect and restore our precious forests."
"There are many wonderful benefits that forests bring, and there are many good reasons to plant forests and prevent deforestation. Forests help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and that helps in the fight against climate change.
But…forests cannot stop climate change from happening. Forests are part of the carbon cycle: they take in carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the wood. When trees die, the wood is decomposed and the carbon returns to the atmosphere. It’s a natural cycle that’s been running for hundreds of millions of years.
The issue is with fossil fuels. Fossil fuels take carbon from deep underground and inject them into the carbon cycle, causing an imbalance. Forests help, but to truly stop human-induced climate change, we need to leave the fossil fuels in the ground."
No.
Good people. We need lots more like these.
DW is probably the best media channel with so many inspiring and positive stories. Thanks DW for sharing and to the amazing people involved in fighting climate change.
"I wanted to work like them and take career like this,but how can I.I am an 23years old guy"
"If city would just line available streets, parks and waterfronts with non-invasive tree bamboo there would no longer be a CO2 problem. They drink up carbon much more efficiently and faster than hardwood trees or other smaller trees used in cities and they grow to maturity in 2 years. Get with it America stop making the same mistakes over and over and over and over again."
Seriously. Indigenous magical thinking? What next leaving offerings to the elves  & forest gods? Praying for climate change?
"Forests will help capturing CO2 from our massive emissions but we break the point for which this is the solution. We need to reduce YESTERDAY the burning of fossil fuels and develop tech to capture CO2. Forests are already affected by droughts and fires which is one of many positive feedbacks.
Leave your cars at home and walk more!"
"Urban canopy is one of the 100 key tenets to expand.

Addressing climate distress is a team effort."
"Great work!
Much needed, Thank you!"
Good mission. It’s a real game of patience.
Short answer : No they can't. Problem solving in a nutshell : Find the root cause (humans mostly in this case) and address the root cause.
"This is how to slow down climate change:

1) Switch from fossil fuels to clean energy

2) Stop or drastically reduce deforestation and plant more trees

3) Stop overfishing"
💜👍
"After the 10 minute mark, the Kogi come into the documentary and offer us timeless sage wisdom. I'm so glad I saw that whole section."
"In our country, Kiranti worship plants and crops as major festivals of their religion. 😊"
"In Sweden, an enormous amount of forest has been cut down in recent years. One generation plants a forest, the next takes the forest out in the form of money. And then the problem with electricity cables down to the continent, which drives up the price of electricity in Sweden in the winter, people are freezing and want cheaper wood from the forest to warm themselves with."
"The logging industry clear cuts and moves on but if trees were treated like a crop or live stock we wouldn't have a clear cutting problem.
In Canada some forests took 100 years to clear cut and no one thought to replant behind them as they moved up the road they had the government make so they could access more trees. 
That road and swath they clear cut could be used for a thousand years if they had bothered to replace what they took out and the new forest properly tended grows faster.
They had the nerve to ask the province to make another hundred miles of road so the could keep clear cutting.

Forestry farming should be mandated for logging industries, it's in their best financial interest to have permanent infrastructure everything local for life, like farmers.
Cut it, replant it, grow it, mill it in one place and never have to move to a new location."
"Actual science.

Without the atmosphere, GHGs and 30% albedo the Earth would become much like the Moon, a barren ball of rock, 400 K lit side, 100 K dark thus negating the GHE. (UCLA Diviner)

UCAR TFK 2009 GHE energy budget uses 63 twice, a math error, and creates an “extra” 396 out of a S-B BB calculation moving energy from cooler to warmer and violating LoT.

Kinetic heat transfer processes of contiguous atmospheric molecules render a Black Body surface and “extra” GHE energy impossible.

There is no GHE or CAGW.

Science has a documented history of being wrong and abusing those who corrected it, e.g. caloric, phlogiston, plate tectonics, luminiferous ether, antiseptic surgeries, medical humors, spontaneous generation, etc.

A bogus greenhouse effect will join that list."
Nothing can stop climate change. It has been going on for as long as Earth has existed and will keep going on for as long as Earth continues to exist.
"Hör auf, Lügen zu verbreiten!! Der frühere Präsident Bolsonaro hat den Amazonas weder zerstört noch gefördert!! ganz im Gegenteil! Im Gegensatz zum neuen linken Präsidenten (Lula), wo wir die Hauptstadt des Bundesstaates Amazonas inmitten des Rauchs so vieler Waldbrände sehen, die jetzt passieren!!"
"""..for us, in this west part of the world, it is still important that we have science to clarify what is happening here"" - capitalism is happening, you don't need science to clarify that."
Oxytree is special plant that consumes particularily a lot of CO2
Good initiative
This is nonsense.
Deforestation has caused climate change nothing else.
Great to see Mike Ehrmantraut and his G. Daughter working together .
I thought we were already beyond the point of no return.
Planting trees in cities is insufficient. Allowing forests and woodlands to regrow is what is needed. It can reverse climate warming. It has done it before.
"Right wing popularists....left wing pedophiles, dont know whose worse ??🤣"
Do we know who organised the Indians to come over? would love to bring them to Portugal.
Presence of tree jist mean living soil
"Every tree counts! And other native or ecologically beneficial plant. Amazing video, very positive message."
"Deforestation, desertification and relentless expansion...  yes we have altered landscapes - persistent ""resident"" overgrazing without relief helps convert marginal into desertification, nature generally has a solution, though many of the migratory ecosystems and species are gone.

Every little helps, island heating is altered massively from  greenery and 3d groundcover.

Nature hates a monoculture - if the  near-monocrop conifers are being destroyed by ""nature,"" replant; hazel, oak, beech..  brambles and the understory browsers.  Industrialised woodchip and ""biomass"" for electric generation - is anything but ""green"" for the earth."
"Can someone explain to me the impact of ""bringing in"" topsoil? Ought we be careful not to just scrape 10x10 metres of healthy earth somewhere else to put it into a relatively unproductive tiny forest?"
Resoundingly…NO!
Im a tree hugger thats here to tell those that are unaware that climate change is happening and always will. No matter what the oligarchs programming tells you we cant stop it. Its part of how the earth works. Now that said we do need to clean up our act and quit being so destructive. The green agenda is a control mechanism nothing more sustainability is human enslavement. Whats the one thing they have yet to charge us for.... to breathe. What do you think a carbon tax is? Further more how is being forced to give a corrupt government money gonna help anything when it comes to cleaning up our act? Its not its about charging you for them to get rich off your ignorance and compliance. Do not let freedom die because wef and the un are your enemy! They could careless about you or this earth!
Got inspired to plant few trees in my little backyard this fall. Thank you for educating me.
When in doubt - plant a tree.
💚
"Trees don't stop climate change they contribute to it. It is well established that trees produce methane a potent greenhouse gas, via an abiotic photochemical reaction. The Amazon alone produces about 20 million metric tonnes of methane per year more than the arctic tundra or oceans."
"Indonesia must stop to increase palm oil plant. It has done by  the greedy companies. 
Enough !"
Thank gods people are finally growing and cultivating those concrete hells they habit.
Great to see these Green Warriors - without trees we are not here....time to do these things in a war footing to save earth.
"We need to do everything. It's too late to be picky. It took two and a half centuries to get this climate catastrophe going and it's going to take all we can do to reverse it, and reverse it we must."
"Why all this for native restoration? Native forests are species evolved to suit their native environment and seed themselves. If you want those species somewhere else in their native territory just take dirt from the native forest and dump it where you want your new native forest in winter so it will grow in the spring. It already knows how to do what it needs to without us. What climate should you grow native plants in?...A NATIVE CLIMATE. what soil are best for native species?...NATIVE SOIL. No nurseries, no teams of scientists and engineers, no hundreds of millions of tax dollars, no heavy equipment. Habitat restoration projects and their price tags are getting bigger and bigger. But make no mistake...it's big business. If you really care about making a lasting impact then make sure whoever you're contributing to is squeezing out the most good that can be done with every penny. The only threat to native species is us so do native species a favor and leave it alone. It knows what to do if you just let nature take its course. All of our energy should be focused on learning how to redesign our societies with a coexistence with nature in mind. What do you think? ...would 4 sequoia giganticus be sturdy enough to support a skyscraper?"
"Farms can probably cool the land to farms because of the moisture,and bricks are just made of mud people could save trees if they use bricks and have longer lasting homes and apartments."
For sure…
"Climate Change - Core Problem 1 - USA, Core Problem 2 - Until both of these nations reduce carbon the ROW will have a minimal impact (it helps) but not enough"
"We need to not replace the trees lost with just any tree, we need to replace the lost trees with the native trees in those specific areas. Please stop putting random trees in the wrong ecosystems."
Its important to plant trees... but the right kind of trees not just to create green stuff
"The council seem to be on a rampant crusade to cut down as many trees as they can where I live. Over the last few years some absolutely beautiful Chestnut, Beech, and Cedar trees have been felled along with too many of the old Lime, Yew, and nearly all the Elm. It's of course down to safety, disease, access or some other pressing issue, but old trees like that need to be treated with more respect, IMO..."
"My dad and I planted our first tree this year in Warsaw, Poland. We planted it in a lawn in our neighborhood. There was so little rain that I kept watering it weekly unit beginning of October. I expect I'll have to water it regularly throughout next spring and summer, until it grows bigger and stronger. I'm planning to plant more next year. If all of us plant just one tree and then take care of it for a while until it grows strong roots, we would resolve the issue of deforestation."
More nature preservation and solutions! So that many communities and individuals can come together and help to inspire change in others. More information can help spread awareness!
How are they sourcing the terra preta? I feel like that can’t be sustainable 😭
"Something for each of us to think about. Creating a tiny forest can be your legacy that will go on into the future and give meaning to your life, while paying it forward for the earth.
None of us needs to wait for someone else to do it."
Nothing can stop Clima change! It's too late.
All respect to you guys ❤❤❤
"Thanks much for the overview of current efforts, DW. Quite heartening. I hope you can delve deeper into the processes that make this successful on your subject matter specific channels."
I personally planted over 100 trees. everyone pitch in
Climate change is one of the biggest lies of all man kind.
The name of this video is not what the video discusses
"Tiny forest, stupid name, big expense and I expect just a silly fad. I have seen these and not impressed. I get that  planting close togeather has it's benifits (and drawbacks) but a well designed  mixed  hedge or planting design would be better IMHO"
I THANK you from the bottom of my heart and soul...
❤
4:18 descendants of German immigrants in South America 💀💀
If we don't plant back then it gonna be a big problem
"""Climate""- the new ""green"" fascism."
More of these kinds of videos please! ❤
There is no one silver bullet solution.we  needs renewable and sustainable energy and green house gases emissions removal aka negative emissions technologies.
"Nice video, some would say too little, too late, but I would say it does not work like this. People don't understand, including ""scientists"", that theese attempts are mockery of natural systems. A forest is a pinnacle of vegetation's succession. A system that includes not just trees of various species and age, but all other life forms in soil and above it. It also includes different layers of canopy, schrubs and vines, fungus etc. All working together; in relation to water cycles and climate types. Natural forests are DYNAMIC systems which have been accumulating fertility for centuries.

You can't just plant some trees in a clear-cut field or a degraded, former monocrop toxic wasteland and expect a success, let alone expect to have a FUNCTION of a forest. Usually theese ""forests"" are evenly spaced rows of young trees of the same species, never pioneering species, planted into sterile and dry dirt, suspectible to all kinds of pests... Nature doesn't work like this, it works through the succession. This is why very few of these trees live long enough, they are dying because the functional support elements are missing. Not to mention broken water cycles...and lack of life diversity.

Thinking only in terms of co2 concentration is going to be our downfall."
"The answer is ""no"" – when it comes to climate change, there's stopping fossil fuel use and then there's everything else. Trees are great for so many reasons but framing them as a silver bullet for climate change is a BS distraction from what's absolutely essential."
Global warming is a myth. Or did they recently change the name to move the goal post?
No volume
"As soon as you plant a forest, someone will come along when it’s fully grown and chop it down… so what’s the point"
what about wildfires
"This is sweet, necessary, inspiring and timely. But can we talk about naming? ""Tiny Forest"" is an oxymoron. It's a woodlot, which has none of the dynamics of an actual forest. That requires scale."
Forests are being cut down for BEEF production.
Comment
"I don't know how these scientists are going to persuade autocrats like Xi and Putin plus their developing nations allies to stop their reliance on fossil fuels. Half the world aren't listening to the other half, so the climate change is inevitable and so is catastrophe. This is all political and Western governments are using it to control us, profit from us."
Absolutely shocking
"Filling the world's sky with sand from the Sahara desert. Pumping the clouds full of Silver Dioxide. Removing all CO2, the gas of life, the gas that makes plants grow from the atmosphere. What could possibly go wrong? Frightening to see the hubris of these megalomaniac 'scientists' and billionaires."
We are heading into Revelation 21...please read the bible. Find your saviour Jesus Christ and look up for our redemption draws near.
Praying these insane people playing God are restored to sanity! 🙏🏻
"Harmful CO2 is buried natural vegetation, from the green planet. A cold and arid world is greening again, thanks the precious buried element's returning to the atmosphere."
"First principles.  There is NO primary source scientific evidence that CO2 drives climate,  that the earth is warming at an unprecedented temperature or at an unprecedented rate.  The only man made climate change is from Michael E Mann's flawed and fraudulent climate models and Geoengineering technology and HAARP."
Yes we lunatics have been calling it chemtrails ever since
Not
"This is a plan by Bill Gates and the evil WEF to get rid of organic food and make us eat lab produced crap. 
Do your own reasearch into Gate's evil twisted plans for us. He is toally insane. Does he really think we believe this rubbish.. ? The planet is only in trouble from the evil WEF."
Wake Up..! Co2 is not bad... they spray Co2 on plants in commercial greenhouses...  why..? because plants need it to grow. Please wake up to the lies in this video.
"Co2 is the giver of life. Plants need Co2 to grow.
It's at 400ppm now, any lower and we are in serious trouble, 1000 ppm would make plants flourish.
Belching rubbish into our stratosphere will kill us thanks to the mentally insane Bill Gates."
"This is a total Lie, it's to control us and make us believe the planet's in trouble... it isn't.... I see chemtrails every day almost 24 hours a day in the UK, the corrupt BBC and Government tell us they are condensation trails, basic sciences tells you they aren't, in fact basic common sense tells you they aren't."

"Remember the trees dying in the smokey mountains?

Geoingeneering is killing everything. This is crazy.
We need to re EARTH..before earth turn into mars!..
"The americans are 'bio-burning' more trees than ever and they have just laid claim to a million square kilometres of oil-and-gas-rich Arctic seabed. They are producing more mass war weapons than ever before too. Doesn't sound like they care about the world at all. Plant more trees - by the billions - at least, for a start; stop cutting them down."
"Why you did not call Dane Wingington, to say you what is Geoengineering do to humanity and all nature on mother earth?"
"She just tipped her hand.  ""...but there are economic interests in the Arctic being navigable.""  Follow the money."
Who died and made you think you are God? CO2 is a necessary component of life itself. You will be judged for what you are doing to the earth.
Drew is a  paranoid nubag that needs a diff  hobby
So when summer isn't as hot as last summer in Ohio it's bc a volcano blew its shit in Columbus
O.4.6° lmao
Not my problem
"Distraction is the best way to lead destruction. Instead of stopping carbon emissions, people thinking all other ways."
Deliberate destruction v naturally grown crops.  Constant spraying v chemicals will cause cell mutations / cancers. All living beings need sunlight. Biology 101
I bet these people will kill us all if gain of function doesn't kill us first.
"it’s already been proven these operations are fully deployed, and are tearing apart the earths natural life support systems. 
Find Dane Wigington."
Just trust nature stop interfering
Geoengineering is a bad idea.
"Not one mention about the number one driver of this issue? 
The Sun 🌞"
"So... Chem trails is not a conspiracy theory, it's simply a conspiracy. Fantastic."
"""I worry that my grandchildren wont get to experience (the ocean) in all it's beauty.""   (because of climate change, so...)

Doctor Frankenstein reborn."
"THE PLANET CANNOT BE COOLED.  Maybe some moderate degree of reduction in heat gain can be accomplished.  10,000 jet aircraft injecting the stratosphere every two years-  We better start drilling for more oil.  Just how much heat is produced by extracting, transporting and refining all that oil into jet fuel and then burning that jet fuel and all the other processes that go along with that?  What would the thermal footprint be for the production of all of the required sulpher?  Gotta call BS at 3:03 , again, NOTHING COOLS THE PLANET- that dust interferes slightly with the incessant heat gain from the sun.  The global temperature did not drop by 0.4 degrees- the local temperature was 0,4 degrees lower as the result of the heat gain being slightly interrupted and adjacent heat not yet being conducted to that area.  What is the thermal footprint of producing a million tons of sulpher a year from production to deployment?  Gotta call BS at 3:48 , there is no cooling power- let's call it heat-gain reduction power.  Why does the sulpher need to be replenished?  does something happen to it?  does it change into something else or combine with something else?  Does it go somewhere, like where?  Does it need to be cleaned-up and disposed-of?  so some studies show the possibility of acid rain?  Is sulpher rain a thing?  This is only nine minutes into this video- wake-up people,"
3 years later?? Been watching them ✈️✈️💦🏜💦 for years now!😎
"Weather warfare as a means of control. Geoengineered drought, flooding and flash freeze events followed by extreme heat (heat dome) events. No, there is Nothing benevolent about ongoing global geoengineering that has been carried out in our skies for decades. SAI (stratospheric Aerosol Injection) spraying of toxic chemicals ie; Aluminum, strontium, Barium, manganese, graphine and other toxic chemicals are inhaled with every breath we take. Geoengineering to cool the planet? No, geoengineering weather warfare used as a means to control."
They are geoengineering currently I am 100% against it.
God damn to geoengineering..😡
Stop Geo Engineering and take seriously reviewing ASAP
"""The carbon dioxide levels are the second lowest theve ever been.THATS WAY TOO HIGH!!! :O"" 🤡🌍☠️"
Stop the madness of nonsense you want to safe earth 🌍 stop flying jets to go 20 miles you Hippocrates.. all you doing is creating an in balanced in the earth china tried it you saw what happened with the magnificent storms they had fools.
"Geoengineering, weather modification is a crime against humanity!!!!!!!! Stop these sociopaths!!! Expose them. Educate people. These evil MTFs block the Sun and I personally feel the negative on my own mental and physical health."
"The solution is to sequester all the Carbon that we have released in the stock of living biomass (as it is presently accumulating in the atmosphere and in the oceans precisely BECAUSE we are not doing so). However, conservation/preservation, as currently practiced, is NOT the answer for two reasons: First, it does nothing to change the lifestyle of most humans. You can’t have conservation here and business as usual everywhere else. Everything is connected to everything so unless we remove polluting, habitat destructive & appropriating industries and human activities from the surface of the planet (and preferably place them in outer space) and SIMULTANEOUSLY create an ecologically literate population and an ecological-based and ecologically-constrained technology and economy, what little good conservation efforts produce will be of little help. Conservation makes people feel good to think that some “wild” areas are being preserved. But this is simply untrue and promoting this lie as true is thus counterproductive. Second, what we currently view and seek to conserve as “pristine wilderness” is actually highly degraded land that was slowly recovering from the extinctions associated with Pleistocene climate change and was then set back and made substantially worse by the processes and demands of agricultural and industrial human civilization. Thus ecological RESTORATION AND ENHANCEMENT of ecosystems to pre-Pleistocene diversities, abundances and functional capacities, rather than preservation of degraded ecosystems, ought to be the goal. Furthermore, the genes of the descendants of species that lived during the warmer periods of the Eocene are a key part of the solution. They should be closely examined and sequenced as genes may be found that can help wild species to adapt to a rapidly warming climate. Wild species (and in many areas domesticated livestock) cannot simply run into an air conditioned space to ride out an area-wide heat wave. Without habitat enhancement, migration corridors and migration assistance and likely genetic engineering, deaths and further extinctions and ecosystem collapse are likely if not inevitable outcomes."
"As both a geoscientist, a systems engineer, a cultural anthropologist and a futurist, I can say that geoengineering is dangerous and that we don’t know what we are doing and that we have been doing precisely that for a long time. As the keystone species of the planet, humans have only three responsibilities: First, to preserve, restore and enhance the planet’s capabilities to sustain human and ecological life — our life-support system for ourselves and for our descendants. Second, to propagate human and Terran life throughout the Universe wherever alien life has not already done so; and third, to protect and defend biological life from those that would destroy it (whether through war, pollution or habitat destruction and appropriation). That’s all! Therefore, ALL human activities must, as a top priority, be directed towards these survival and subsistence objectives. Doing so leads to eternal life — as a species — and evolution towards an ethical being. Any other course of action is not only unsustainable, it’s ignorant, criminal, insane or stupid and ultimately leads to human self-extinction or eternal death — as a species. No gods need be evoked to punish or save. We determine our own fate by our own decisions and actions. Obey the laws of sustainability and live, disobey and die. No exceptions."
"Being against research seems shortsigtened. When we look at the models we see it does notmagically stop at 2-3 K warming That is the warming with a doubling of CO2. But we are not heading at all to that 560 ppm mark, we are heading for much more.Also: we do not know what tipping are to be expected with 2K or 3K warming or even less.... Also: if climate is more sensitive or if models underestimate the warming (there are models that predict a lot more warming) we could go up to well over 3K warming or even 5K. 
So what could be happening is really extreme: the loss of the Taiga forests in Canada and even worse Russia (much bigger), loss of reefs, loss of icesheets with 3-7 m sealevel rise an din short a global extinction comparable to the Permian one. The problem is not CO2 in itself (it is when it comes to ocean acidification) but the temperatures. The heat. Of course CO2 is at its basis, but in itself CO2 is pretty benign. Its effects in our atmosphere are not. And countering that side-effects and lowering temperatures could halt that extinction event. 
Another problem: the longer we wait the more drastic cooling might be needed to stop processes that really only can be halted with a return to pre inustrial levels. So if we need to use it as an emergency, it could well be that that drastic breaking is not without its unwanted side effects. 
With so many unknowns, with a world in 2023 not stepping on any break when it comes to curbing down CO2 emissions in spite of consequences seeing all around us, we are heading for a warming that is so diastrous we need to curb this warming trend sooner, not later and we need to research the best possible way to do so. I hear people talking about a moral hazard. What moral hazard When we look around us at least in my view: what morals? Isn't it striking that in times of enivornmetal problems causing all sorts of damage it are rightwing parties everywhere that are winning, not losing? Look at Trump who is at it soon again or someone of his ilk, look in Europe. There is golbally a political unwillingness to tackle the emissions. There are no morals when it comes to CO2 emissions so never mind a moral hazard when it comes to research. DO mind abuse of technology by those very same people who can and will use technology that is not well researched when consequences of their own inability to act on the fundamental problem puts them in dire straits (locally). 
There are no good reasons at all not to research this and blurting out claims by scientists on this topic without good research is rather unscientific and therefor more emotional.

I would like to note that in my view much of those who are against research do not seem to live in countries like Tuvalu, Pakistan, Indian where in various way people face existential threats already due to the warming. It seems we can say this as long as we in the north do not suffer similar consequences. But once we do and this will be sooner than later, see how opinions of those that matter changes...

My take is that we need to research it as soon as possible and if it is benign, we should also use it sooner not later. Because the worse the warming gets, the harder we need to step on the breaks whichin itself could be a true shock for nature."
Manufactured climate crisis in the name of #carbontax
"This guy's theory about resolving Global Warming by using a Sun Reflective Layer in the atmosphere, has obviously NOT worked, since we are not approaching 2024 and the Global Warming Event is still on the rise. Also, This Scientist, nut job's theory about a Reflect Layer in the Earth's Atmosphere; has created more damage for the Earth Dwellers than ever. It is truly amazing how all of these so-called Scientific Experts are actually the Scum ruining the Plan-ET."
"Are you kidding me... THE WHOLE FREAKING SKY IS COVERED IN CHEMTRAILS...
  HELLOOOOO"
Not to mention the residue upon the leaves which then are unable to properly release oxygen into the already then chemically saturated air. Reflecting light and heat from the atmosphere back out towards ozone layer further reduces the ozones integrity and ability to sheild the planet. No country or scientists should EVER have a project going without the proper input of fact based knowledge and decision of the people for a long-term permanent solution. Humans have become a suicidal life obliterating lesion upon this perfect planet. Incorrigible irresponsiblity. Im stunned
The particles in the air are killing insects and birds. The frequency of a bird's chirp is what stimulates the leaves in trees to release oxygen into the air! This is another asinine suicidal short-term experimental solution with devastating long-term consequences.
"CO2 isnt bad. our earth did it on its own alot worse than we can, well except the part where the geo engineers put particles in our skies which are pollutants all of their own. which is killing our ocean, our biosphere. and then us. weeeeee watching humans destroy the planet is fun.?

and david keith is a pos evil sub human world destroyer. guy isnt helping anyone or anything, quite the opposite."
"as if geoengineering wasn,t going on since many years! hahare!!!"
"the main disinfo is to think that co2 is a problem! 
in fact it is essential to growth of plants!"
More propaganda
Hands Off Our World Our Planet You Lunatic
"the REAL def. of climate change is: Man-induced artificial weather control/GEO-engineering...and for those who feel the need to control...keep in mind, ""the more you resist, the more it will persist""...mother nature cannot be fooled and will always win, always...even at the expense of the creatures that live upon it...and seems to me, we are headed for disaster...mother earth and father sky will be fine, but not those residing upon it"
seeding clouds is the problem
"Anthopomophogenic global warming is a face - a control tool  to suck the energy of the sheep. They are the madmen in control and view us all as their own personal ant farm. ""They"" are enemies of humanity and as someone recently said, are legitimate military targets."
Lol the freemasonry own all views and ideas from a planned failed socialism to totalitarian control just do the right thing elite rich we o lyrics need so much money and control and that's healthy not narsassim and own everything it's all mk ultra over fishing over farming going the wrong way continuously for wall street and the reserve bank .

Horrible ideas.
"We have had the ability to modify weather for a long time so how do you know that the weather we have now isn't purposely done? In order to enslave control and drain the resources of the people on this planet. Plus all this talk about CO2 being an issue when we actually need it, plants do better with it. And the actual data shows that what we're being told is not true."
These Fulkersons are nuts
Another pLanneDamnic? Follow the money and control people.
PROPAGANDA COMMERCIAL
"The forests are burning!!!! Clear cutting without managing the new growth is one of the big reasons. We can see these fires from space while they are small enough to put out, we should!! We should manage the forests. We should plant more trees and stop cutting old growth forests. 
This would be by far better than spraying dangerous chemicals from jets as we have been for decades now."
"I know they have been doing this for, at least, more then a decade now.. Ten thousand jets every two years blocks only two percent of the suns rays...you know how bad jet exhaust is for the ozone layer?  Something like two hundred thousand times worse than car exhaust! These jets probably eat more than two percent of the ozone....I think this layer they spray seems to actually lock heat under it like the plastic sheets of a green house does. Also these metals they spray are detrimental to people and animal and our immune systems,  they are being found in our  drinking water and everything else. 
It's amazing to me people could really be so stupid as to think this project is a good idea..likely there's money to be made and that's why it's happening"
I'm sorry you cannot do this you're going to throw us into a ice age if you just start cleaning up your emissions and stop letting corporations pollute that's the solution not putting more crap into the air
DavidKieth is a total nut job out of Harvard University trying to alter weather patterns.
The world is not in trouble it is people that have a problem we are coming out of an ice age
"Look, studying clouds we have no problem with. Nor do we with sending up ashes or natural things but aluminium and barium thats shot up in chemtrails to be breathed in by us making us sick? Thats a crime against humanity and its being done all over the world for decades. Its monstrous!

It's so obvious"

LEAVE THE EARTH ALONE..!!
GO AWAY WITH YOUR GEO ENGINEERING  😡"
Thank you DW for all of knowledge give to people 🙏
"The intentional spraying of aersols to block the sun, cause cloud cover or rain etc, should be punishable by death."
"The sky is falling!
Mass psychosis"
David Keith is Canadian I think he has wanted to try spraying the sky a long time. We will breath it. Methane from thawing muskeg is a way larger contributor than co2. Manditory co2 scrubbers on all new high rise buildings.
One of the worst ideas in human history
"Uau , muito interessante esse documentário"
Slaves of the money lol humans slave for paper and buy paper to flush down the toilet into the rivers and oceans and complain about global warming 😮lol😅

"I don't think preventing hail by using Silver iodide is a good idea. Why not build stronger roofs, do early harvesting and any other method. To me, preventing hail is like too much of an overstretch. Why not allow hail to fall, and if it affects plants too much, Germany cannot lack to build a greenhouse or have appropriate alternative crops, assuming damage to crops is what made them to such great 
lengths of weather modification."
Is this why I wake up to the smell of fireworks EVERY DAY? 😷
INSANITY to follow the climate scam cult
And when a big volcano goes off it will magnify the effects of the meddling and potentially thrust us into an ice age.
"These nano particles they put in the upper atmosphere eventually falls to earth. It might be the cause of all these fires around the world, they should start taking soil and water samples for testing"
"The age of lunatics, when they get a decent job?"
You dim the sun and solar panels become less efficient.  I am sure the particles sprayed in the atmosphere will do wonders for our health as well.  Not to mention when it rains and those particle go into the soil.  What could possibly go right.
"Want the truth about climate change google Milankovitch Cycles.... The climate change scientists in this video are wing nuts with a God complex. Science requires research. If any of these people had done the research, they would understand Climate change is Cyclic and proven in the historical evidence the earth provides us. How many ice ages, followed by warming periods has the earth experienced? Climate change is NOT new and NOT a direct result of mans impact on the earth. The earth does not have a circular orbit around the sun, it is an elliptical orbit. And for all the so called scientists mentioned in this video, that means the earth's climate is effected by not only how close or far away the earth is from the sun during that elliptical orbit, but also the activity of the sun during the orbit. This includes solar cycles, solar minimum, solar maximum and sun spots to name a few. Add to that El Nino and El Nina, which are also cyclic, occurring every 2 to 7 years.... From it's beginning, the earth has experienced extreme weather conditions as a result of all these conditions. If these were Real Scientists instead of ego driven God wannabees, paid by special interest groups, they would have done the research!"
Comment
How does talking about climate change make you feel?
"How do we get people to care about climate change? Explain the effect of food production and climate change. Then, include the need for large solar-powered cooling centers like stadium size, which can be co-used with sporting events, vertical farming, emergency homeless housing, etc. Then, explain solar-powered water distillation from the air for clean drinking water worldwide. Use solar-powered sewer plants that also produce nitrates for food fertilization. Lastly, build dense solar-powered, tornado-safe, and flood-safe housing. Explain geothermal energy, bladeless power-producing windmills, and solar powered with battery backup water tank hydropower. Then, explain that climate change is exponential, and explain wet-bulb- temperatures. Hopefully, a few of the 1% will fund our survival."
0:00 you've had such a big pause before disclosing how much time they have spent on covering the climate change that I stopped caring about the climate change
"There is nothing we can do to change the climate, not the changes we're experiencing. And ""no one is talking about it"" really, you people won't shut about it, there's thousands of elites flying in private jets whilst telling us to stop driving cars and eating beef steaks whilst telling us to eat bugs currently in Dubai... everywhere you go it's climate change this climate change that"
Maybe there should be like a new Nobel price for Environment or something #climatechange #planeta
"With how much coverage of disasters get, climate change could be THE trending topic"
"The UN's IPCC AR6, chapter 12 ""Climate Change Information for Regional Impact and for Risk Assessment"", section 12.5.2, table 12.12 confirms there is a lack of evidence or no signal that the following have changed: Air Pollution Weather (temperature inversions), Aridity, Avalanche (snow), Average precipitation,  Average Wind Speed, Coastal Flood, Agricultural drought, Hydrological drought, Erosion of Coastlines, Fire Weather (hot and windy), Flooding From Heavy Rain (pluvial floods),Frost, Hail, Heavy Rain, Heavy Snowfall and Ice Storms, Landslides, Marine Heatwaves, Ocean Acidity, Radiation at the Earth’s Surface, River/Lake Floods, Sand and Dust Storms, Sea Level, Severe Wind Storms, Snow, Glacier, and Ice Sheets, Tropical Cyclones.There is no objective observational evidence that we are living through a global climate crisis. None."
Leaders of the country are mainly responsible for this. That's just the facts. The only way to get real change is to get enough ppl to care enough to vote out ppl who arent doing anything significant to reverse the effects of it.
"Great video, but academic format boring. Should be pyramid format. Also, the gloss over neo liberalism and freedom you touch on the latter. But that's the point, what if your point of view is amoral. You need to perhaps find a format like Adam Ruins Everything and stimulate the probables and get feedback on the un-proven. All in all, USA like UK media is neo liberal lead and directed. I say start with things which affect people, easy -  displacement of people due to climate change. Or how about a certain country tired of land filling   UK waste and sent it back. Maybe  Helen Mirren and the new trash continent, or maybe the Australian study which suggests that dumping at sea and currents means that waste in the shore with the (best eat by dates) suggests trash dumping close to Australia"
I care a lot about the environment but I agree it can be quite depressing and feels very hopeless and intangible for MOST people yet here I am🤷‍♀️⭐️🌎
"talk about hydrogen planes, solar panels and eat beef - climate change solved"
Because we damn well know climate alarmism will be used against us. Just like with covid it will usher in policies that are bad for people on many levels.
"People tend to only show concern when major events or personal circumstances affect them. As humans, we often prioritize our own interests and fail to extend the same level of care and concern to others. This raises the question: why is it so hard to care for others? Perhaps it's because there's no monetary reward for doing so. However, if we want to make the world a better place, we need to start caring more. Though it may be challenging, it's important to start taking action now. After all, if we don't start now, when will we?"
"Even this excellent video didn’t really talk about climate solutions. The most important is to legislate a global reduction in fossil fuel production. There need to be severe penalties for overproduction. This will drive prices up and demand down. Fossil fuel producers should be allowed to keep some of this extra money to encourage their cooperation, but most should be refunded back to people to help them invest in alternatives and/or be able to pay bills. Over time the escalating cost of fossil fuels will encourage companies to invest in cleaner alternatives (e.g. hydrogen planes, electric cars, better construction) or they will see reduced demand for their products. Today fossil fuels are so cheap most people just don’t care about the impact. Lack of government action also sends a signal that maybe climate change isn’t as big of a problem as scientists are saying."
One reasons it's hard to care is because people like you embrace emotional images of polar bears to generate fear while ignoring the data that claims these bears are thriving.
"It’s the bankers, they are the bad guys, no, it’s the drilling machines that cause over usage of fossil fuel. It’s, manufacturing, it’s the climate bomb, It's the time bomb's fault…
Make me a persuasive offer and I’ll stop using products that cause climate digression."
"It's hard to care, because there's nothing to care about. Globally the ACE index (accumulated cyclone energy) 1980-2021 shows no increasing trend. Global Hurricane Landfalls 1970-2021 (updated from Weinkle et al, 2012) shows no trend. Satellite data since 1980 shows a slight downward global trend for total hurricaine numbers with 2021 being a record low year. The IPCC reports in AR6, chapter 11, ""The total global frequency of TC [tropical cyclone] formation will decrease or remain unchanged with increasing global warming (medium confidence)."" Not that I really care about what the IPCC says. Multidecadal variability in Atlantic hurricaines is most probably related to the AMO (Vecchi et al, 2021). NOAA data 1851-2021 shows no trend in number of hurricaine landfalls with the record high being 1886. What the data from NOAA SPC shows about tornados: EF1-EF5 (1954-2022) no trend; EF3-EF5 (most destructive) (1954-2022) 50% decline. No EF5s in US since 2013 (a record absence).
The Global Land Precipitation Anomaly from AR5 will disappoint with deviations from the average increasing by 0.2% per decade, but if you look at the actual data, it's just very variable over the decades. 
Drought appears to be decreasing globally (Watts et al, 2018) measured by SPI 1901-2017. 
For every million people on earth, annual deaths from climate-related causes (extreme temperature, drought, flood, storms, wildfires) declined 98%--from an average of 247 per year during the 1920s to 2.5 in per year during the 2010s.
Data on disaster deaths come from (EM-DAT, CRED / UCLouvain, Brussels,Belgium. )
Globally 2000-2019 there was a large decrease in cold-related deaths and a moderate increase in heat-related deaths (Zhao, 2021, Lancet). However, coldwaves are over 9 times more likely to kill than heatwaves, so the overall result is very beneficial. 
What else? Oh, deserts like the Sahara have shrunk considerably and the Earth has greened by 15% or more in a human lifetime (NASA). 
The Great Barrier Reef's coral cover has reached the greatest extent ever recorded. 
On extinction the rate is very low: 900 known lost species for 2.1 million known species in 500 years. At that frequency it will take over 930,000 years to reach 80% extinction of species experienced at the K-T boundary that saw the extinction of the dinosaurs. 
There is no climate crisis."
It makes me feel like doing something about it and sharing what I have done. Avoiding fossil fuel consumption is in my power and I'm doing the best I can to do it. Electrify your life it's simple.
too complicated material...
I really scare about the effect of climate change. Poor children.. I am sorry 😭😭😭
Climate Change? I will remain a skeptic about it.  I know alot of people are making it up.
I don't care because is wrong to think that you can control the whether off the entire planet . climate is cyclical
"I find it difficult in certain ways, because I don’t know what can actually help on a macro level because so much of it is politicized in my country by leaders that have proven themselves untrustworthy over other issues.
 I also don’t like handing this issue over to the government because they often go well beyond their own sphere of responsibility and can cause harm if they take a heavy handed approach to this as many seem to when given other responsibilities and power. 
I’ve spent time trying to research and seeking out the data and keep finding articles that just express ideas without statistics, and because I am still learning I find it very difficult to know what to think."
Collective power over individual responsibilities
Boring
It’s truly terrifying that humans don’t want to see or live in denial. God we are a disease
"Surely countries like Pakistan and Kenya are always talking about it, and about  the drought and elsewhere flooding that results from it. The biggest culprits  are authoritarian countries like Russia that starts damaging wars, and China which is industrialising at a high rate and still has large population growth, even though its oldest people are from one-child families, or are claimed to be. We cannot reform these two countries without going to war. Even then, civil wars and military oppression  flourish as each party tries to blame the other."
Germany is very serious my airbnb host was so nice and he invited me to breakfast and all he asked of me was to be aware of the climate and recycle and take action he was an older man too.
"Y’all should contact a YouTuber named mr.beast, he has an audience of over 100million people and I think just making one video of him dedicated to climate change, we could stand a chance to combat it, he has things for the environment in the past such as planting 20 million trees so his audience is really good at teamwork, I think it’s a good shot to contact him if you can"
"The only thing real about climate change is that the climate changes all the time, every day, sometimes more than once a day. The fearmongering is being done for only two reasons, money and control, nothing else. The tragedy is that people will willingly bow and submit to this as they have done so many times in the past. People need to get their heads out of the sand and take back control of their lives."
"For decades the US/West have enjoyed the best of the planets resources and contributed the most to global warming. Now, Simply because they control the UN,World Bank,IMF and SWIFT and have nukes they’re trying to dictate to emerging countries the order of business on climate control. You can’t rule forever."
"I feel like a problem that’s also not talked about that much is that young people (teenagers, kids, young adults) who grew up hearing about climate change are just tired of hearing of it. At least in my experience (I’m currently 17) I’ve grown up hearing about climate change and how in a couple of decades when I’m older the planet is going to be very damaged and how my future kids are going to have a very different and worse life than me. Even in school in classes like geography we were constantly hearing about it and had to do projects with a lot of research about it, and on top of that we were also getting a grade for learning about how our planet is going to die. So much negativity is mentally exhausting for anyone let alone children so I feel like it’s only natural for us to want to forget or ignore these issues as a coping mechanism. In the end projects like fridays for future were often used as an excuse to skip school instead of going because of our genuine concern. I think the way people talk about climate change has got to change a lot and unless we see actual action and solutions taking place instead of hearing empty promises all our lives we most likely won’t feel inclined to help"
Capitalism
"The general mood in American fractured culture is, "" Kill the messenger"". The few people wearing a mask when the smallest estimate by the government is over 400 dying daily and over 120,000 new cases daily, are stared at as though they are committing some kind of crime."
"If the Russians allied with the Chinese, and moved over a million troops to the east and west coasts, and those troops started to spread out toward the middle of the country, soon were reinforced with another million man wave, and the soldiers demanded the people feed and house them, and the soldiers had their way with the populace, the American Media would not mention it at all. Americans would be so surprised when Russian or Chinese troops came to their door, demanded food and lodging, and shot all the young men and people over thirty."
okay but you can apply this to any (worldwide) conflict #ukrainedonations
"Carbon capture technologies and breakthroughs in clean energy get me excited, more of this please"
"Provide links to something actionable, a database that links a person to climate friendly candidates or initiatives in their area. People care but if you just keep feeding them a scary sad story but give them absolutely nothing meaningful that they can DO about it then they will eventually just tune it all out."
been hearing the polar ice caps will be gone in 10 years for almost 50 years. its been drummed over and over with nothing happening making people indifferent about the topic
"Very heartbreaking. 
But this is not new.  
The fossil fuels peddlers have already bought up the corrupt politicians and corrupt media for years and years !
Scottish scientists have confirmed that the oceans acidification has caused the collapse of the phytoplanktons by 90%. That is our only source for Oxygen.  
So kiss your children goodbye."
Please stop using fossil fuel of any type.
i feel frustrated 😩🥴 that our French government Macron doesn't care or do anything and 2022 summer is 41°C
its because its too expensive. its not like theres any affordable EVs
"one of the main issues is that the 'average' person is tied to working and not likely financially stable enough to make the kind of changes that need to be made such as installing solar panels on their home. We are all somewhat victims of the societies that we live in and the need to survive, to afford food and shelter etc. There is also the issue of how much energy and production it will take to make these new forms of energy, solar panels, wind turbines etc... mining the metals for example. People want to help but when it requires more than buying a reusable coffee cup the issue becomes too much of a burden because to truly solve the issue all we would have to do in theory is nothing... keep hospitals and necessary services running whilst our main sources of power are changed over and we can rebuild this 'new' society... but in this transitional period it would disrupt the functioning of the economy, how would people eat? earn money? It would cause a philosophical crisis as well as a societal and structural one, we have not been educated emotionally or intellectually as people enough to pick up these kinds of huge challenges and these times that require empathy more than greed and selflessness over a desire to do what we want such as go on holiday and eat certain food... we could solve all these issues tomorrow if we were willing to make drastic decisions and let go of many things we don't really need but we seem afraid to let go and to face ourselves... there are many issues at hand in facing climate change and not enough physical time for people to solve them, I don't think it would bring out a positive aspect of human nature for us to be faced with sharing food, letting go of the desire for more, having to remain where we are etc. Coronavirus was a huge test and we changed essentially nothing about our societies and people seem less happy and connected since it happened. We did not grow as people we just watched tv for 2 years and then started again. It is quite scary really."
How about reduce Fossil fuel subsidies
"For the last 1 year i have been discussing this with so many people, everyone i talked to cared about climate change and wanted to do something about it. 

But at the end of the day i feel we are trying to save our convenience and not our planet..."
"I never really cared about climate change, global warming/heating etc because since 2k I kept hearing that evry 5 years Wed be dead due to weather. Now, I don't really gaf because we've screwed up more things that are affecting us right now than something that'll will ""happen"" in yet another 5-10 years and they'll change the name yet again. This feels like a relative saying they're going to change but never do and keep reassuring they will eventually. So I don't care about polar bears or how much China is polluting the world. Till then we have ww3 to worry about."
"The Earth is cooler w the atmos/GHGs/albedo not warmer.
To perform as advertised the GHGs require “extra” energy upwelling from the surface radiating as a black body.
The kinetic heat transfer processes of the contiguous atmos molecules render that scenario impossible.
No greenhouse effect, no GHG heating, no man/CO2 driven climate change or Gorebal warming."
Because it has always been happening? The globe began warming 10000 years ago when the last ice age ended.
"In desperate times (and the climate crisis and several other eco disasters should make us desperate indeed) we need drastic measure. Deep inside we all know that - and most of us detest it and try to deny that fact. Changing e.g. the food or agriculture sector would not be enough by far. Culling the traffic sector, especially flights, would be needed too, but nobody accepts that so far. Many other habits, from our manicured gardens to crypto currencies to the horrible garment industry (fast fashion) to second homes, should be dumped. No sign of that so far. In older times I would have said we change our attitudes in glacial speed. But that would not be correct anymore, would it?

In fact, it is not sexy to waste less, consume less, especially not drastically less. True frugality is not a good look on Instagram. Also, life is short and people want to live it to the max, no matter the consequences (""bucket lists"", ""places to see before you die"" or before they get ruined). Hence, hardly anyone wants to hear about it. 

Since we tackle neither population (via contraceptives!) and instead use wishful thinking in that area, nor change drastically in respect of consumption and waste, our timid leaders decided to do some cosmetics on the corpse. 

That is the sad truth: Changing to renewable energy is not the silver bullet, nor is e.g.  veganism in the West. (It could have been enough if we would have implemented that decades ago.) The measures needed would be drastic and need the participation of quasi the entire world. And that may only happen when it is far too late to stop ""vicious cycles"" in the climate. Hence the lack of interest in talking about Climate Change. At all."
"Many of the solutions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions have other (more immediate/local) benefits as well. For instance the Dutch system of urban planning, where infrastructure is focused around bicycles and public transport (in oppose to private cars), has been shown to be a very efficient use of space and allows much larger volumes of people to move back-and-forth with relative ease. Not the mention the improvements in urban air quality, which also come with EVs (yes, I know there are issues with the manufacture of EVs and electricity generation for charging - but that can be cleaned up - burning fossil fuels in ICEs can only be cleaned up to a certain extent).  

So in terms of selling policy changes to the public - perhaps the focus should be more on the more immediate/local/relatable benefits on de-carbonising? Rather than abstract climate change?"
Because it is a natural cycle and we will never be able to have any affect on it! But if we don't prepare for the coming minimum 1/2 the world's population will die!
"11:18 indeed, we ARE close to the solar maximum."
"Yeah ""I am going to use the bus and stop using my car and I am also going to change my behavior"" so that  the millionaires do nothing and they keep polluting"
"The only viable solution to climate change in our lifetime is nuclear energy, but DW keeps misinforming about and villanizing it. 
So DW are the biggest hypocrites in this story!"
Look at asap science why being environmental friendly is a scam to get the real story.
"This is all I want to talk about for past few years ( I live in Pakistan) but it makes people very uncomfortable. People are not as much in denial anymore though, rather they are more nihilistic or just resort to religion and God will take care or useless technology shifts like solar panels and planting trees etc, i.e as you point out, uninformed action. The internet and active searches on it make the difference at moment for those who care to understand the climate crisis, and many more such videos etc are needed to come to a collective understanding that may steer things towards addressing the crisis in more effective ways ...at moment it is quite hopeless , please keep informing ...more power to all the journalists in this video"
Do you think maybe it might be that climate scientists who receive funding from government intuitions catastrophized and exaggerated their conclusions as a means of generating more financial support for their livelihoods and in the process destroyed the trust of the citizens who pay for their research?
"Hmm why could it be, maybe because no one believes the doomsday predictions that have been going on for 50 years, because you guessed it, every single one turned out to be false"
"For in stance (we should take) I heard today on another YT video that merely sweeping like iron &/or some other metal rust dust into the ocean causes/feeds phytoplankton to the point of blooming. Basically that's the base of the food chain for marine life. Then it's also the major source of oxygen that could restore the ozone layer. 

Mostly cuz the media is corporate & corporations stick with/appease their advertisers -- basically, all corporations & industries stick together against the people because our shared common interests, like fresh air, crystal clear waters, safe workplaces & livable remuneration etc all run against all corporate industrial causes. 

Also known is deforestation-style logging, AKA clearcut logging, destabilizes the climate & is turning the Earth into like a moonscape. This because the use of petroleum coupled with deforestation has the carbon run off into the ocean where it has a devastating acidifying effect & melts the polar caps from below thru ocean convection. Forests are nature's carbon sink that our oceans were never meant to become. 

Forests also are key to nature's hydrology (H2O) cycle, making fresh water in abundance all the way inland & does so without flooding. Rains in temperate forests are typically light rains.  It's this current rate of rapid deforestation causing the wrecking ball swing of droughts & floods & wildfires & temperature extremes too.  Selection logging that doesn't highgrade protects relative old growth while maintains canopy for hydrology. There's your answer, cuz it would localize the economy & so benefit all concerned."
"Oh please, if climate change really is as significant as is being claimed...we're already fckd. None of the measures proposed/taken by governments have actual benefits for the environment. NONE whatsoever. Zero."
"Because it'll happen no matter what we do, it can't be stopped, it happened before we came to exist and will happen again, the best we can do is delay it a little bit.

Human hubris makes people think they can actually stop a inevitable natural occurrence but we can't."
"As long as any fossil fuels are burnt, having children is not forbidden and capitalism exists we have nothing to talk about."
"If you give people real life solutions for cutting emissions but their comfort stays the same, then they will change habits. It's not about I can not do much for environment. It's about comfort."
I am going to set fire to a garden full of tyres and drive the long way to work due to this woeful conspiracy ridden programme
"I haven’t really cared so far. Since I saw the diagram how the life will change and think about my small kids and maybe grandkids I am getting frustrated and ready for action.

I think the easiest target who will care about climate change are people with kids. If I did not have kids, i would not care because it does not affect me too much, i just use one more air conditioner."
"algea bloom seeded through ironoxide release into the oceans would fix ""cliamte change"" in less than a decade, they know this and have stopped the people doing it.....sicne you can't make money from a problem that doesn't really exist."
"Companies are waiting for the situation to go worse, so that they can capitalize on it."
It's hard for me to care about climate change when environmental activists are usually the biggest bulwarks against the most proactive means to reducing carbon emissions.
"As we've seen with the pandemic and corresponding actions for two years, 'science can change', it can be politicized, agenda-driven, etc.  World-wide.

So the byproduct of that, naturally, we're going to see more climate skeptics now than ever.

Frankly, the objective of removing as many widely-used airborne toxins from our economy should remain regardless of this.  But for climate issues requiring trillions of dollars to 'solve' as opposed to millions... That will encounter more scrutiny going forward."
"I just want reasons not to shoot myself, not reasons to."
"The real reason is, because the people that push for climate change panic the most, actually only exploit it by making up laws that transfers money from the poor to the rich, while doing nothing for the environment. Guy on the street must give up his car and become unemployed, but climate activists fly with private jets to climate summits."
"Use classical conditioning, when someone says climate change is false, punche them in the face... (?)"
"It's hard to care because you people aren't targeting the right audience. You need to convince young, RIGHT WING, men and women. There is a lot of anti-corporate rhetoric right now, bring back the Rage against the Machine aesthetic and you will get young right wing men boycotting oil CEOS."

Anyone in Southern California want to start an educational organization? Start talking about this in groups and branch out?
"Humanity will never solve climate change with its science, it will solve with its spirit. ❤️"
"We need some guidelines and manuals for the public to refer to… everyone knows it’s the issue, but what should they do to fix it? Let’s stop blaming the big industry and greedy politicians because we can influence their self-interest based on educated purchase/voting decisions. Public in current timeline don’t have a clue as to what they need to do…"
For every new  activist ....another  with an opposing  view will spring up...
"Just talking about Climate Change is just a worthless waste of oxygen! Let’s all drive in our fossil-fuel burning cars to some convention and talk about it in a way that makes us feel like we are helping; and then we can jump in our cars and drive to our homes feeling better about ourselves.
     This is such a hypocritical scenario; and it plays out in so many instances!"
"I notice a lot about citizens demanding and asking for solutions from our governments or companies.
But I never see them make a public ""request""...Like on the 8 o'clock news simply ask all ppl to like separate their Plasics from their waste.
Instead of trying to make complicated rules and laws that take a lot of time (to much time).
Ppl don't mind if they are asked to do something, they can say yes or no...but a lot of ppl dislike being told what to do.

Let's say My prime minister asked to make 1 day of the week no meat day, like  Veggy Friday...no meat for a day.
And from all the ppl of my country, a 1/3 does this...suddenly all veggies have disappeared on Fridays.
And we humans are ppl of habbits, to let's say 50% falls back in their old lifestyle...thats still 1/6 of a country moving greener.
Repeat this process, and show results from the ppl that decided to make this move from a simple request....prob moves a lot more ppl in the right direction then debating a year about a law."
In here in the US most people live paycheck to paycheck. That fact alone explains how people are not forward or future thinkers.
"There's a disconnect between all cultures being so strong on family and children on the one hand, and the world's lack of concern for the future of our grandchildren on the other. This is incomprehensible to me"
"Its easy to care when it's making you fantastically rich like many climate change experts and bureaucrats, it's harder when you are being impoverished by it like everyone else..."
"was wondering this recently. There is almost no climate change coverage on news and social media. Something i see around me is climate despair - people have given up, or rationalized the issue. And as highlighted in the video, if people are made to feel guilty about everything (plastic, planes, milk, meat, clothes, cabs!) - they can either get bogged down by guilt (like me, it sucks to do anything) or ignore the issue and move on.
Also, over the last few years, public memory has run short - we go from one topic to another. Covid kept us hooked for a couple of years but now we are back to the short news cycle territory. Climate change needs continuous coverage for a long time - its not a short term issue, its not a easily solvable issue - and no one is going to watch this coverage.
I was reading Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut today. the book came out in 1970s and the sarcasm around climate change actually made me feel something - maybe that's we need. A wave of content which makes light of the end of the world - to shake people out of their despair and complacency."
"We have to talk more and more with all the people we know, until this topic will be the topic No1 discussed all over the planet."
"With these types of thoughts and reactions on the subject the issue will never be adequately addressed by the general populace. People need to stop burying their heads in the sand and face the reality that we all must take action to slow down and mitigate as much as possible the damaging impacts of human caused climate change.

The effects are being felt NOW. And will worsen into the future. This isn't some distant future occurrence you can ignore. And it isn't something far away from you. Everyone is experiencing it NOW in some form in your local region: more intense heatwaves, wildfires, hurricanes/storm systems, drought, rising sea levels, glaciers (there are glaciers in america like in Montana and Alaska). 

The sun has seemed hotter because it is. And it's tanning people a lot harder and earlier in the spring seasons than it has before if you're astute enough to notice. People in the norther hemisphere's tans are really pronounced and that was before summer actually started. There are a multitude of effects climate change is having. Get with reality folks. Take action to save your species and the all life on Earth."
"This video seems rather odd. There are climate change stories everywhere in the media. But I see virtually no coverage of the root causes: overconsumption of energy and overpopulation. And hardly anything on humanity's daily brutal treatment of other life on Earth, which is not unrelated."
It's not hard to care about climate change.....It's hard to convince oxymoronic politicians and greedy businessmen about the importance of stepping up the fight against climate change.
Humanity 😴😴😴🐑🐑😴😴🐑🐑🐑are more interested in celebrities wedding & divorce law suits than Global Climate change
They’re gna care by the time when it too late…..
"Here are a few quotes not often found in mainstream media from some experts on the global warming agenda.

— “The common enemy of humanity is man. In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.” —  Club of Rome, premier environmental think-tank, consultants to the United Nations. 

— “We need to get some broad based support, to capture the public’s imagination… So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts… Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest.” – Prof. Stephen Schneider, Stanford Professor of Climatology, lead author of many IPCC reports.

— “We’ve got to ride this global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic and environmental policy.” – Timothy Wirth, president of the UN Foundation.

— “No matter if the science of global warming is all phony. … climate change provides the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world.” – Christine Stewart, former Canadian Minister of the Environment

— “The data doesn’t matter. We’re not basing our recommendations on the data. We’re basing them on the climate models.” – Professor Chris Folland, Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research.

— “The models are convenient fictions that provide something very useful.” – Dr David Frame, climate modeler, Oxford University.

— “It doesn’t matter what is true, it only matters what people believe is true.” – Paul Watson, co-founder of Greenpeace."

"From .03 to below .02 and plant life starts dying off, then it's obvious what a drastic change from .03 to .04 can do to the world around us, by your logic"
Eight percent! 😁😆😂🤣
"It is extremely easy to make bullshit claims when you lie about numbers. For hundreds of thousands of years co2 has never went above 300ppm and now is past 400ppm. We gained 100ppm in less than a century. It is not going down. Acting like 0.04% is insignificant is an ignorant and dangerous take, as if a small number means nothing to the atmosphere. Well there are plenty of dangerous things that will kill you if you ingest less than 0.04% of your body mass. The more reasonable way of seeing that small number is that it went 33% above the highest it has ever been and there is a direct correlation to co2 levels and average global temperature."
"The people freaking out about CO2, saying it is causing the end of the world, don't even know that it is a minute, trace gas, that is critical to all life. It is group think, insanity."
So these people are in charge of something to do with CO2 and are ignorant? How ridiculous
"Australia finally did an assessment of how much CO2 their green belt; trees, brush, etc. were consuming.  It was in the millions of tons which is far more efficent and cost effective than CO2 capture plants, forcing people to drive EVs and other boondoggle wastes of taxpayer cash."
how about stop cutting down trees that converts co2 into oxygent
I never saw so many uneducated suits sitting in one room before. Pushing all this EV stuff is totally ridiculous.  they sit around talking all this CO2 stuff and none of them knew the percentage in the atmosphere. The earth produces gas and oil. It's the earth's renewable resource. And one eruption of a volcano puts out more emissions than America has put out in 100 years. And there are 1500 active volcanos on the earth. The earth can handle anything man throws at it. And the Earth is doing very well. But Lithium is not produced on the earth. It is an element. What elements are here on earth. Is it folks. They are putting an unstable element digging it up and putting it in places it shouldn't be. They even used Lithium in the atomic bombs. Lithium is also used in mental health treatment. Maybe all this mental health problems are being caused by exposure to too much Lithium.  Lithium has a low flash point. It needs to be kept cool or cold. Animal life and people are not supposed to have Lithium in their bodies. These people are creating far more problems than they are trying to avoid.
"Green does NOT refer to the environment, but rather the vast amount of money that is harvested by governments under the guise of having to save the planet."
HERES AN IDEA WHY NOT GET NASA IN THERE TO EXPLAINE IT TO YOU ALL
"HERES THE FACTS HES LEAVING OUT 
CO2 makes up only about 0.04% of the atmosphere, and water vapor can vary from 0 to 4%. But while water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas in our atmosphere, it has “windows” that allow some of the infrared energy to escape without being absorbed. In addition, water vapor is concentrated lower in the atmosphere, whereas CO2 mixes well all the way to about 50 kilometers up. The higher the greenhouse gas, the more effective it is at trapping heat from the Earth’s surface.

The burning of fossil fuels affects the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Before the industrial revolution, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere was about 288 ppm. We have now reached about 414 ppm, so we are on the way to doubling the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by the end of this century. Scientists say that if CO2 doubles, it could raise the average global temperature of the Earth between two and five degrees Celsius. We are already increasing the amount of energy that bounces back to the Earth. Because of the greenhouse effect, this is causing global warming with its many destructive impacts."
YOU BETTER LOOK FOR ANOTHER JOB...😂
i'm certainly no politician but i knew co/2 levels were less than 1% but he definitely made fools of these people
"The sun is approximately 93 Million miles away from the earth. So applying similar logic, the sun can't possibly have any impact on the Earth can it? 
Nonsense logic has been used to misrepresent the problem we face. Just because the percentage of CO2 in our atmosphere is low, that does NOT mean its impact is low. High school science :)"
"0.04% the net zero sheep.
Whats its all about then.?
Ev more power less power plants equals ...blackouts..."
So you don`t know how much CO2 is in the atmosphere but its getting even more? How is that ?
"Climate change is a Marxist hoax to give Government absolute control over what you can do and where you can do it. It's all grade 1 BS peddled by the UN and the ""global elite""."
"Its bad that folk don't know the basic facts. It's also bad to suggest that, because its a small percentage, it doesn't need to cause concern."
.04 percent (or 4 parts out of 1000)   Remembered it from my college days   nice to see thirty years haven't changed it much
"Just shows whst a con all this climate change stuff is. In the Uk its even crazier as were aiming for zero emissions, yet we emit a tiny percentage of the world's co2"
I love the fact that these Scientists are ALL WRONG by a Country Mile  …. Now that’s what I call Precise Science ….😂 😂 😂
"What is this  ??? These people sitting here  ???
Please common sense 
Scientist with facts !!!"
An administration SO CONCERNED with climate change that they blow up the Nordstream pipeline and not a mention of any investigation worldwide
"% of atmosphere that's co2 is about .42%
% of atmosphere that was co2 for the rest of human history was about .27%

Mass of atmosphere is estimated at 5 x 10^15 tons. That means that each .01% is about 5 x 10^11 tons. A quick estimate shows that we've added 7.5 x 10^12 tons of co2 since the beginning of the industrial revolution.


This really isn't the gotcha question he thinks it is as long as you do some simple math."
The Sun's behavior does not operate in accordance with politically driven scams.
"I originally posted a comment to this video two weeks ago. A reply to that suggested my comment was a strawman argument. I replied, offering further information, and that information was deleted twice. I am posting again for the third time and will add additional information. I hope the channel owner or YT , whichever is responsible for censoring , will act with integrity instead of cowardice this time.

Cuurent CO2 levels promote vegetation health and growth. The Industrial Revolution began 264 years ago in 1760. CO2 levels in 1750 (10 years before the industrial revolution began) were approximately 278 ppm. That's an increase of 142 ppm in 264 years or averaged to .54 ppm per year. At this rate of increase, it would take nearly 10K years for our planet to exceed the 5K ppm level of CO2 required where toxicity or oxygen deprivation could occur for humanity and other oxygen breathing animals. That's not taking into consideration exponential increases over time if we continue poluting our atmosphere.

I'm all for cleaning up our planet, let's start with picking up our trash. I'm also all in on developing a cleaner and more efficient method of propulsion, but digging up the enormous amounts of lithium, cobalt, manganese, nickel, and graphite needed to make the quantity of batteries required for short trips around town only to require frequent charging on a grid which burns coal, natural gas, and oil to generate nearly 70% of our electricity is like washing our clothes in muddy water. We can do better than this."
"CO2 in atmosphere = 0.4%. 
Below 0.2% plant life start dying."
Out with the C02 lies! Out with the liars!
"Is it really 0.4%  now?
That means it's doubled since I was at school. Hmmm."
Man-made CO2 is 0.01%
Actually it's about 0.04% so the answer 5% is close. Currently he amount of CO2 in the earth’s atmosphere is higher than it has been in at least one million years.
how can some of these people not know how much co2 is in our atmosphere its like year 8 knowledge its 0.04% not 0.4% 0.04% how can people in such positions not know basic science and who is making decisions on science its embarrassing
"Shows that they are doing it for political reasons or they would know at least the most basic facts about what they say thier exoerts on. As soon as they were asked they probably thought, ""Fuck!"""
Testifying on something that they are supposed to be the most knowledgeable about and are literally cramming it down our throats because they think they kniw better when they dont know the most basic fact.
💯
Truth like this hurts when we here it
"People listen to me. S dot O dot S dot.; the big brother google is modifying this thread in real time. I literally spent the last 5 hours here and I SAW COMMENTS DELETED, comments up-voted, comments promoted.

You think I'm lying? Sit here for 5 hours updating the page every minute. I GUARANTEE you will feel like 1984.
Do not go away. 
Don't.
Are you going to defend your rights or not? Decide."
"I would love to have asked him, “What percentage of Carbon Monoxide in the air would make your brain go to sleep permanently?”, because it’s in the same relative proportions as CO2 has on the global climate."
"Pathetic answers... They wanna ""change"" the world but know jack sh... about the thing they're dealing with."
The fact that CO2 is such a small component of the atmosphere is the problem.  It means we can change it greatly with human activity.
True perspective on CO2 and the electric vehicle myths.
This is why I still believe in American Democracy!
"Plant some trees they absorb co2 and emit oxygen,its not rocket science egg heads!"
"Thanks for your comments, Michael, The figures are being discussed in terms of volumetric analysis.  In short parts per million by volume.  Where the density of the air is low or high the ratio of the gases that make up the air are, for all intents and purposes, the same.  The figures are based on the average concentrations and expressed as a scientifically agreed international standard atmosphere.  In terms of anomalies, Yes, if you took measurements on top of a factory chimney or at the Arctic there may well be considerable differences.  We have to look to what we consider a useful and representative number that will enable judgements to be rationally made."
"Oh yeah, about climate change, how about looking at the eons long cycles in temperature the earth has gone through and will continue to go through. If you do that research you will find out that we are now coming out of the last ice age, the very end of it. Guess what happens when an ice age ends. Right temperatures rise. Mankind has very little to do with it and never has. Don’t worry about the planet, it will take care of itself. People may be discomforted but thats the way it goes."
"Well, jolly glad that we got the industrial revolution started as the CO2 levels was well below this figure before then."
"Heres an idea, how about stopping the cutting down of the earth's rainforests!"
400-1200 ppm ask grower or Polish 10yo kid 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 leaders 😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂
We have to thank the Jews for the shit thats being pushed onto us
"Without climate change, the world is in Big Trouble 😔"
"If every private citizen had net zero carbon footprint, 100 companies would still cause 70% of all green house gases...so obviously the villains here are private citizens!  We must force private citizens to use the most inefficient (and expensive) energy, no cheap gasoline or coal or natural gas! 

Nuclear energy?  What's that?

Anyway, be sure to eat the bugs, live in the pod, and own nothing just like the WEF says!  It's the only way to save the planet!"
"When I was a young lad learning my trade as a chemical engineer the back of my steam tables had the CO2 levels as 300ppm.  Now, as a retired engineer, I'm told the levels have reached 400ppm and, if true, this is not good."
All of it
The whole Climate Crisis is a scam.
❤ TRUTH is POWER ❤
"As someone who IS concerned about climate change, I am severely disappointed in these answers. I've known the concentration of CO2 since I was 12, and could've told anyone in that room that five or eight percent was far too high from an earlier age. All I see is a huge mis-allocation of effort and honest legitimate climate science being tarnished by people who just want to use it as a trojan horse to implement social policy. I believe governments are more interested in weaponizing climate issues as tools of oppression than actually solving the problem, because if they wanted to solve it, they would be embracing vastly different solutions. It's pretty clear throughout history how America acts when we want to solve a problem (buffalo extermination, the transcontinental railway, Panama canal, the FBI, the Manhattan project, Saturn-V, the covid vaccine) and regulation isn't it."
"So at .02% CO2 plant life starts dying off, by this logic I guess a small % change/increase in CO2 concentration may be important."
What a stupid argument lol the fact that CO2 is a thin fraction of the total atmospheric gases doesn't mean that greenhouse gasses can't cause climate change.
Exactly.  The world is rapidly descending into darkness and satanic evil by the gross ignorance and stupidity of people like this panel and governments pushing this big fat lie of climate change
"""Experts""?"
"""Experts""?"
"This board of “experts” should have known how many ppm of carbon is in the atmosphere. But this is a ridiculous argument. Just because it’s a small percent does not mean it’s insignificant. When that small number doubles, then triples due to human activity there are massive climate consequences."
".04% is CO2
0.3% is possibly manmade 
.03% is possibly the amount America’s responsible for 
soooooo

They want to tax us
$41 trillion to correct.00012% 
of the atmosphere? 😂"
They’re ignorant and yet they’re in charge of regulating the weather
Destroying the economy and the middleclass based on fairytales.
"It’s by over fishing, fish stabilize our planet fish carbon over fishing reduces that fish absorb and regulate co2"
"Fools and frauds should be aware that if they still wake up every morning it is because:
1. CO2 is the molecule of LIFE, 
and,
2. My good pal Vlad' extraordinary patience."
"What is the percentage of Ozone in our atmosphere? I mean it  absorbs 97 to 99 percent of the Sun's medium-frequency ultraviolet light, without it  life wouldn't be possible because the sun would destroy all living cells?🤔
WHAAATTTTT???!?! 0.00006% ??? That is far less then 0.04 % CO2🤯 And it has such an impact.

Doug LaMalfa just showed that he has no clue about climate change or physics. What an ididi!"
The numbers are fixed back in the 60s you're lying to us the Earth is going to change if we're here or not
This guy is awesome!
"In Australia, our trees offset the carbon emissions massively, in fact, we can offset our region. Who's knocking down our trees? Btw, oil prices, like petrol prices go up and down. Without competition, electricity prices only go up so you have now giving the power for all transportation to the electric company boards. Clap clap clap. Genius."
being led by the ignorant.... frightening reality !
"I just asked ChatGPT about current CO2 concentration and the minimum concentration required for plants. It's pretty much in line what the guy said and absolutely devastating for the anti-CO2 agenda. I haven't wondered yet about a minimum:

As of my last update, which was in January 2022, carbon dioxide (CO2) comprises about 0.0415% of Earth's atmosphere by volume. However, this percentage can vary slightly depending on location, altitude, and other factors.

Plants generally require a minimum concentration of CO2 for photosynthesis to occur efficiently. This threshold concentration is typically around 150 parts per million (ppm). However, most plants prefer higher concentrations, ideally between 300 and 400 ppm. CO2 is a crucial component of photosynthesis, as plants use it along with water and light energy to produce sugars and oxygen. Without an adequate supply of CO2, plant growth and productivity can be limited."
They don't care about facts because it's all a lie .
"to a question like this, one should instantly ask; ""are you asking by mass or by volume?""  Meaning, the question is not clear."
They have no idea but they want money  for a climate change that's not happening
Its a climate hoax
from 0.02 to 0.03 in 20 years is a 25% increase. 25% in that time period is a lot!
"it is 0.04%, but that is 0.04% of 5.1480 × 10000000000000000000 kg (it was 0.02% before the Industrial Revolution)18"
"What he only forget to ad was,  if the co2 is as low as 0.4 % the changes are more dramatic then if it was at 21% (like O2 is), the moment the % drop or raise by the same rate. 

If the O2 level drops by 1% that is not a huge problem, but if that would happen to CO2.... we die.
The otherway is true as well.

Now, the question should not be, why are we paying so much money, while we only produce in our country only 1or 2% of the climatechange gasses, while China and India alone are responsable for 45%.

The question should be, do we care if in say 100 years, our families still have a planet to live on and if we care what they would think of us, who could do something about it, while they see their loved ones dying around them.

We knew this in the 80's.
We are 40 years further. Things got worse. Prizes went up...
 We are going to wait another 40 years, just to say:"" we do not have enough money to make a difference, they should have started in the 80's, when things were not as expensive as today""?"
"Humanity pumps 33 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere each year. Levels are at 426.8 parts per million, (WM Keck Observatory Hawaii). Almost doubled since we began monitoring in 1958.

Furthermore, I suggest researching the ""Keeling Curve.""

Without a doubt. Man is disrupting earth's equilibrium.

By the way, our atmosphere is mostly nitrogen."
These people are in charge of energy planning?
Climate change is biggest hoax. Stay against it.
"History

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

The SDGs build on decades of work by countries and the UN, including the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs

In June 1992, at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, more than 178 countries adopted Agenda 21, a comprehensive plan of action to build a global partnership for sustainable development to improve human lives and protect the environment.

Member States unanimously adopted the Millennium Declaration at the Millennium Summit in September 2000 at UN Headquarters in New York. The Summit led to the elaboration of eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce extreme poverty by 2015.

The Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development and the Plan of Implementation, adopted at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in South Africa in 2002, reaffirmed the global community's commitments to poverty eradication and the environment, and built on Agenda 21 and the Millennium Declaration by including more emphasis on multilateral partnerships.

At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012, Member States adopted the outcome document ""The Future We Want"" in which they decided, inter alia, to launch a process to develop a set of SDGs to build upon the MDGs and to establish the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. The Rio +20 outcome also contained other measures for implementing sustainable development, including mandates for future programmes of work in development financing, small island developing states and more.

In 2013, the General Assembly set up a 30-member Open Working Group to develop a proposal on the SDGs.

In January 2015, the General Assembly began the negotiation process on the post-2015 development agenda. The process culminated in the subsequent adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with 17 SDGs at its core, at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015.

2015 was a landmark year for multilateralism and international policy shaping, with the adoption of several major agreements:

Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (March 2015)

Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development (July 2015)

Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 SDGs was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in New York in September 2015.

Paris Agreement on Climate Change (December 2015)

Now, the annual High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development serves as the central UN platform for the follow-up and review of the SDGs.

Today, the Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG) in the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) provides substantive support and capacity-building for the SDGs and their related thematic issues, including water, energy, climate, oceans, urbanization, transport, science and technology, the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR), partnerships and Small Island Developing States. DSDG plays a key role in the evaluation of UN systemwide implementation of the 2030 Agenda and on advocacy and outreach activities relating to the SDGs. In order to make the 2030 Agenda a reality, broad ownership of the SDGs must translate into a strong commitment by all stakeholders to implement the global goals. DSDG aims to help facilitate this engagement.

Wow! That was epic!
"He is wrong the real figure is 400 parts per million which equates to 0,0004 % of the atmosphere"
"""What percentage of our atmosphere is CO2"" 
0.04% is CO2 - how come these guys don't know this?!!

""Tiny change in CO2""
Would it be alright if I put a *tiny* bit of strychnine in your glass of water Mr. LaMalfa..? Just 0.04mls of it..?

""Why are they shutting down hydroelectric dams and nuclear power plants?""
Good point - I don't know why they should, considering, if what you say is accurate, nuclear power plants are, currently, one of the cleanest and safest ways to generate power.

""Restrictions on CO2 emissions are holding up projects""
Guess how long we've known about what CO2 emissions could do to our atmosphere? We had a very rough idea in the mid-late 1800s! And a much better idea in the last 50 years! And we *still* haven't adapted our infrastructure.. If not now, then when should we start?

On the other hand, if the projects don't do anything to help with CO2 emissions *and* help people continue being able to live a decent life, then scrap them, they are useless."
"And there is always the propaganda panel under the video that reads: ""Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels."" Ain't that wonderful?"
0.04 percent
all climate denier commenters here paid for by oil companies
"CO2 is measured in ppm. A 2-digit is used if you want to hide something.
In the 50s we had around 300ppm. Today more than 450ppm.
600-800ppm is catastrophic. Even    optimistic not liberal people like Elon Musk warn about that rise that will come with feedback effects."
"These government committee members have dangerous ideologies, we will be third world countries within a generation if we don’t wake up very very soon"
"The increase from 0.03 to 0.04 is +33%.

The % as a magbitude itself in the atmosphere is small.

The %change and its effect is important."
Ridiculous..
brawo!
320ppm -> 420ppm in 50 years is a 31% change. A very rapid one in comparison to ones we have seen naturally
"CO2 level pre industrial was about 0.2 percent, not much, now it's just over 0.4 percent (as Doug said). That's 2 times more than an ""ideal"" level, but crucially TOO high, and enough to tip the balance. Look to the science, talk to the scientists who are the experts in this area of science, not politicians not TV presenters not celebrities, not someone who knows how to frame a question in a slightly different way to confuse the issue in the minds of us non experts. Doug has been most disingenuous."
What a bunch of ignorant people
"Doug confuses % composition with % effect.  Caffeine is only 0.04% of your coffee, its effect is greater than 0.04% though."
"It’s not about CO2 y’all worried about the wrong things. It’s the balance the equilibrium we are not focusing on… what nuances will cause issue that threaten food, shelter clothing and water👀

How does the 7 deadly sins tie into destroying of the things that’s keeping us alive?

Why we focus on agenda and who’s side we on? Why not remain neutral and pay attention to both perspectives?

Why everybody care about profit they don’t care if they hang them self and people around them in the process?

Again we are having the wrong conversation and people who have knowledge but lack wisdom… all our leaders just have knowledge and no wisdom but they are here making decisions🤦🏿‍♂️ some malicious, gluttonous and greedy"

"Global warming is fake, just give them money it's all they want"
"Where a person falls on the climate change issue has more to do with people's psychology, Pessimist, Optimist, or Realist.  The Climate Change Activist are Pessimist:   see the worst aspect of things or believe that the worst will happen.  Some people are optimist:   tends to be hopeful and confident about the future.  I am a Realist:  things are changing but I see many positives since the world population keeps growing, the change in temperatures went exponential after 1960 when the world's population grew from 3 billion to over 8 billion, we need the benefits of a warmer climate, plants/algae/phytoplankton love CO2 because photosynthesis combines CO2 and Water to produce Oxygen and Carbohydrates,  we need the oxygen & food.  Humans are effecting the balance, population growth is the cause, more CO2 is the solution."
"This isn’t because of burning fossil fuels. The earth does this, back when they built the pyramids it was a luscious green land, now why all of a sudden is it a barren desert? It’s because the earth shifts and changes, not because we’re burning fossil fuels. What about the polar shifts Bill?"
you know its bad when bill nye is warning you

Water vapor is the highest % green house gas in our atmosphere, plants like that too, Don't be fooled, the earth goes thru these cycles we melt and freeze, melt and freeze the poles move around and get closer to the sun, lava heats up from below like Iceland is experiencing all the planets do it without man, everything we do like decommissioning Navaho generating station with responsable stack scrubbers then sending it to china were it will have none, brilliant idea! Then the solar panels that have toxic chemicals in them like cadmium that will go bad or wearout by the millions that have to be processed and recycled at $100.00 a pop will cost more when you put them up, wake up people its called science not propaganda!"
As much as I love the things this earth provides us with like utilities and foods but we are currently consuming more than the earth can produce and it’s showing through this
Al Gore would be boasting over this because he warned us. Everyone thought he was crazy.
Just know you are wasting our time
"One of the main reasons that polar ice is melting is because of the heat brought in by the AMOC circulation! If AMOC is slowing down by the melting, less heat will be brought in, and in turn it will slow down the melting!"

Bill Nye is the Furthest thing from an Expert when it comes to anything to do with science. He has a bachelors degree to be a teacher. Just like Bill Gates he has 0 expertise yet claims to be an expert. Hey Bill Antarctica used to be a tropical paradise. Changes in climate have occurred for millions of years. This guy has literally no scientific background whatsoever he just repeats what’s the talking heads tell him to. Hey @BillNye How much of the Atmosphere is CO2?!? .003 percent?!? Hmmmm that’s quite a negligible number. The amount of methane that Joe Biden released when he attacked the Nordstream pipeline had a more dramatic effect on climate change then the last decade of the worlds vehicle use. Why don’t you hold yourselves to the same standard Bill?!?
That has got to be the worst click-bait title ever.
Every person should watch The movies Agenda and Agenda 2. This will explain the entire plot behind the 2030 agenda. The world government is trying to push this narrative. The lies are running rampant.

fuck it fr
"Just another reason I'm not too enthusiastic about having a child. If this much has happened in my lifetime due to climate change, and it will only get worse and accelerate from here, I'd rather not bring a child into this rapidly dying world of greedy and ignorant-by-choice leaders. Hopefully the worst will happen after I'm gone, but I don't know that my children won't suffer in their lifetime. The movie ""Don't Look Up"" shows exactly what this looks like in an accelerated manner. It may be a movie about poor world leadership during an imminent world-ending comet strike, but it's actually holding a mirror to what we actually look like today in the very real and current crisis of global warming. If you didn't pick up on that, you weren't paying attention."
Y’all heard bill let’s get to work 🏃‍♂️💨
"well explained, Bill Nye Sir!"
Earths biggest downfall.....Humans.
"The weather has been crazy all around the world, seems like the end of the world, but it will only get worse over time"
Wow ice turning back into water what a fucking shock to the world
nobody talking about him saying the fix is voting...
The only reason people think climate change is fake is because big corporations who make bank on pollution are telling them so.
"Engineer, not a scientist. Pretty much just parroting real scientists and people warning climate change. This is nothing new."
So we need to salt the water
"Yeah, but you know none of us is going to do a damn thing about it."
Greenland  for a reason. Lol
Well lets see iceland was once ice and greenland was once green without people. And if we were truly concerned the US wouldnt have destroyed nordstream 2 releasing record amounts of methane out in the ocean. Im sure letting hawaii burn or the ohio train crash were also helpful. Not to mention the private jets of all the members of the W.E.F. that shove climate change down our throats while more carbon then we could ever stop as basic citizens.
Bill nye is not a real scientist he’s an engineer why aren’t they bringing actual scientist that have degrees for this stuff
i thought the thumbnnail was bo2 loading screen in the background
Only scientists I trust 🫡
Sad dig into politics… election years are funny
"Man, I used to watch him when he had brown hair, woooow."
The flowers are blooming in Antarctica
Bill nye is a good loving person sad to see only so few people care about our “home”
why doesnt this have more views or likes….
Bill Nye the Science Guy with no degree and hella stupid political views
"Until majors cities starting to flood to the point of no return, humanity will not learn. So sad doesn’t matter what you believe, we are heading to the same doom."
Bill nye is a moron with a very rudimentary understanding of almost everything. A mechanical engineer is not a scientist.
government is why we CANT do it.
"With more water from the land and circulating in the ocean, would this mean stronger storms? Which will also impact eco systems, which will cause chain of events for nature to balance...?"

Whst is happing to me
They're probably taking it in storing it fresh water
"What difference does it make? They'll never stop drilling? And the government does not give a s***As long as they're making money, the world could set on fire and they could care less, so why even cause panic? So it's basically a waste of time"
When CNN backs someone you know they are dumb as all day.
"Humans are the only species that if we disappeared today the planet  starts healing tomorrow,  every other animal serves a purpose,  not us its almos as if were a Disease"
Just like the dinosaurs. We're another species destined to go extinct.. like all others even before the dinosaurs. We just have that sense of awareness..
"We gotta listen to the scientists!
They should be the celebrities we’re obsessed with"
How coincidental this is coming up with the election near. CNN IS A JOKE
We just need to restructure and adapt. Build plateaus and be smart for the future
What’s so bad about vegetation growing? Climate change is inevitable. We live and adapt
We’re so dead…
And if climate change is the cause china is the main coporate
Climate change doesn’t exist
Efforts for depollution have increased worldwide temperatures by clearing skies and allowing more sunlight into the earth… on top of co2
GGs to the earth we know today lol 😭
"He's basically saying. ""Ice are melting!!! We Drowning Nigga!!!""  😂😂"
"Undoubtedly change is inevitable. There is scientific evidence that the earth tends to yoyo from one extreme to another.  There are millions of years worth of climate related data available. The percentage of those sets that coincide with the era of human existence is very very low. The overall consensus is a precice pattern seems to play out.  The truth is it doesn't matter not one bit if climate change is connected with or specifically caused by modern humans ? We are wasteful, destructive, parasites on a giant living breathing organism that has the authority to shake our species out of existence if we are not careful! We should be better in all things, including self governmence!"
"Something else that is INCREDIBLY important to be made aware of. Is as these HUGE amounts of ice melt, they are uncovering diseases that were frozen in the ice. So all the ice melts, and these diseases get released that we may not have cures or vaccines for. So this puts a HUGE amount of stress and concern literally for our lives.
We as humanity are doing all of this to ourselves! We keep on spewing more and more crap into the atmosphere that is warming the planet. It won't be a giant asteroid that will end humanity. It will be HUMANITY that ends humanity."
"Don’t get me wrong I’ve always loved bill nye but the truth of the reality is he’s apart of the propaganda machine, he never was a scientist, he was an engineer and a great actor. But I do not trust one thing the news says."
Bill Nye is a hack and a liar he isn't even a real scientist even the rat from Beakman's World is more credible than Shill Nye the liar guy
We’re officially living on the grand line🗣️‼️🫡

"Absolute lies, don't listen to the bs from the MSM people. Use your own intellect. 

What is net zero? Its absolute BS that's what it is. They say co2 causes climate change.  Ok let's look at the science and really think about it. 

The specific gravity of co2 is 1.592. Which means being heavier than air. How can any scientist explain that a heavier than air gas somehow gets into the atmosphere? IT CAN'T ! 

Co2 can only fall downward. Its subject to the same laws of gravity and yet the sheeple are still convinced that what the government and mainstream science tells them is true. 

Wake up world  :) they are all liars."

It is estimated that if we proceed with this green energy Madness the cost to the United States will be nearly $5 trillion dollars a year for decades to come
"In my area, Ohio, mosquitoes are at a record low. If there's one thing you should have learned a long time ago it is the weather will change."
Increase in CO2 has resulted in creating green spaces equivalent to the total land area of the United States where there was no green before......
"The Atlantic shelf in the Chesapeake Bay and much of the East Coast geologic plate is very slowly dropping in elevation.  I work with surveyors who own highly accurate GPS and since the 1990’s have set, checked and rechecked their NGS survey control annually.  The whole east coast is vey slowly dropping in elevation by a few mm’s a year.  This has apparently been going on for millions of years but we humans who developed GPS in the 1990’s only proved it with the invention of GPS.

Curiously in the Great Lakes and north in Canada to the Hudson Valley region the land is very slightly increasing every year, why?  Only 20,000 some years ago there was a mile or two of an ice sheet bearing down on this area.  With no more ice sheet the ground is very slowly rising making the Great Lakes appear to be dropping in elevation but it is the land without an ice sheet that is very slowly expanding or rising up slowly by mm’s every year."
Here’s the next fear mongering hoax as predicted.
Wow. I feel bad for those that watch this as a source for news
"Translation from the Leeuwarder Courant (Dutch newspaper) of July, the 28th  1 8 4 6
Hot SUMMERS.
Behold here the exact list of the Hot Summers which have been noted in Europe, and of which the historians speak, beginning with the seventh century of our era.
In 658 the springs dried up; 879, at Worms, the workmen fall dead in the fields; 903, the wheat and the fruit are dried up; 1000, in Germany the rivers and springs have dried up, the fish has rotted and this brought forth the plague; 1022, men and animals die of the great heat; 1132, the earth splits open, the rivers and springs are gone, and the Rhine in Elsas is dry; 1159, everything is dried up in Italy; 1171, great heat in Germany; 1260, at the battle of Bela, the soldiers, like flies, fall dead to the ground under the scorching sun; 1276 and 1277 no fodder for the beasts, because of the heat; 1299 and 1284 even greater heat; 1303 and 1304, the Loire, Rhine, Seine and Danube have dried up; 1393 and 1394, great drought in Europe; 1446, extreme heat; 1473 and 1474 the earth is as if burned, the Danube has dried up in Hungary; 1538, 1539, 1540 and 1541, unbearable heat; 1556, the springs have dried up; 1615 and 1616, drought throughout Europe; 1646, extraordinary drought; 1652, the greatest heat to be remembered in Scotland; 1698, strange heat.
The first three years of the eighteenth century had burning Summers; in 1718 the theatres’ in Paris were closed. Not a drop of rain fell for five months and the thermometer in Paris stood at 36 degrees (Réaumur: 36°R = 113° Fahrenheit). The grass and the wheat had dried up, and the fruit trees had bloomed repeatedly; 1723 heat and drought; 1743 and 1743 and 1746, very warm summers; 1748, 1754, 1760, 1767, 1778, 1779 and 1788, extraordinary heat. In 1751 1753 the thermometer measured 37 and 38 degrees (115.25° and 117.5° F); in 1802, Paris was the greatest heat ever recorded since the discovery of the thermometer; the heat climbed to 39 degrees (119.75° F). In 1811 Summer was very hot; in 1818 he was intolerable. One still remembers the great heat that prevailed in Paris on the 27th , 28th and 29th  of July 1830. In 1835 the Summer was very hot. At last in Paris this year 34 degrees (108.5° F.) in the shade, and almost 40 degrees (122° F.) in the sun and with no wind, for instance in the square of the Louvre.
(Up until the middle of the 19th century, the temperature in Europe was still mostly measured in Réaumur. 1° R = 34.25° F)
... and all of this without the global warming of CARS, FACTORIES, AIRPLANES, INDUSTRIES etc. A miracle that there are still human beings on this planet."
Has anyone checked the sun's vaccine status? I think it's racist and it definitely hates white people show ur support for climate change to get 20 vax shots if you are feeling extra democratty get 30 shots #vaxthesun

There is a  community here . They claim that they are high class .They use BARBERS( this barber class is used by that high class as slaves ) in their marriages as slaves to undershave their bridegrooms.This is done as a ritual of their caste system.i am sure no other class so this practice.it is a kind of slavery system.
I filed a case in our high court .( This because those youths were going beyond even attacking girls of our society in weaker section areas some little Gospel)( I got angry and God led me and showed me this their evil practice in my eyes .
Pray I am the one and only one to raise voice here .( Only my brother and my family is support to me ) 
Pray 
Court and  governments must stop this .
But 
Credit must come to us .
BECAUSE I did this because I got angry because of the love of our christian evangelist girls ,God showed me those class people's evil practice in my eyes after .( This is a slavery not known in any parts of the world except here .the present government is for that high class and by that high class .
Will anyone oppose God ?
Is there anyone powerful than the God who gave us this command Gospel?
Will anyone fight our God Almighty.?
This my cases is example to us that God is watching.

"Science can prove that climate and weather (two different things) are driven by solar and geological events. What we see today was predicted years ago and it’s all natural. Rely on proven science rather than political science.   We must note that the Hudson Bay has proven to be very interesting and argues against many of the political scientist that keep beating the drum of human caused climate changed.  In a new study (Gupta et al 2022), 73% of the 15 sites under study have cooled and 11 of these sites have cooled an average of 0.34 degrees C per decade."
The climate has been changing since the Earth began. It adaps and changes with it. Nice fear tactic though
"China, Russia, and India account for over 85% of the worlds pollution but CNN has it's viewers convinced that the main problem for climate change is Americans not driving EVs🤦🏻"

"Obama doesn’t seem too concerned with climate change. He bought a beautiful multi million dollar home right on the water in Martha’s Vineyard. The climate goes through cycles. Anyone who actually cares to know history knows this. There are entire ancient cities underwater. The hubris of our culture is amazing. Do people here realize that in Alaska our country is investing in infrastructure to benefit from the changing climate? Russia is doing the same. New trade routes in the Barring sea will open. Our leaders use climate change as a way to distract us from our actual problems. If people actually paid attention to what our government has been doing, there would be huge revolt. Look around the world, people are fed up everywhere. Funny CNN isn’t doing a single segment on that. Ask the Farmers in Holland and Poland how they feel. Ask the Shri Lankans."

No person is above the law!  Listen to former DOJ Eric Holder, you can and need to prosecute Trump.

since January 6 2021 not one single Republican lawmaker has been held accountable for their insurrection actions.  they will win re-election if not arrested and they will cause more chaos and mass shootings.  Put an end to the evil Trumpist Republicans and support the good Republicans and good democrats.

MAGA Trumpists are ramping up their war machine to lie about their insurrection!  Dont believe the lies!

More Very Disturbing Trends -

1 Law enforcement has NO OBLIGATION TO  HELP ANYONE...that is what their Union will fight for during investigations and trials.

2 Law enforcement cant be prosecuted for Not doing their jobs

3 Law enforcement can legally lie unless they are under oath at that moment

4 The District Attorney will side with the cops almost always

5 Law enforcement has qualified immunity, which makes it very difficult to prosecute them


Texas Shooting Coverup .....over 18 armed evil trumpist c o p s had over 11,000 live rounds of ammo and they waited.  and waited.....while people were being killed.  it took the border patrol to take out the shooter.... how sad is that?

"Unfortunately, it's already too late to reverse climate change. Governments, business and the scientific community know this already and some have always known. World governments' current stagergy is to transitions slowly to renewable energy while continuously adding to the problem. This is obviously not going to work because once you built the renewable infrastructure, the unstable climate will slowly but surely destroy it all. An alternative method is to curb humanity's frivolous 'freedoms' by squeezing the economy to facilitate only basic essentials; ridding ourselves of excessive 'world traffic' and unnecessary pollution. (Localised fundamentalism) Unfortunately, the selfish nature of humanity won't allow for such a endeavour, which leaves us at the mercy of a technological solution. (It didn't work out for the Sumerian gods if the text are to be believed). My advice to protesters of such a NOBLE cause; please stop wasting you time and energy. Our authorities live in a warped reality, and will not understand until they feel it in thier bank accounts; at which point it will be far too late... as it is already. Sorry peepz. ❣"
The earth is heating up. It's not because of man's actions. It's because of God! It's because of sin.
"Here in Ireland, where summer is just missing on our shared island this year, Climate Change has meant the arrival of several invasive flora and fauna in recent decades, species and plants that aren't remotely native to our island and never have been, yet here they are, now, proving problematic in some places.

Global warming affects us by making us colder and damper (it's already too wet here, thanks!), with increased storms and related weather.

As has been noted by politicians and environmentalists here over the past week, America's disastrous Supreme Court ruling against the EPA affects us, too, with the global implications of their corrupt ruling.

For our American friends across the pond, sure, several of their national parks will also be affected, in line with increasing fires, devastating storms and extreme weather - all of which will also ultimately filter back down into national economic pain for everyone, but millions of citizens and a hell of a lot of their Far Right Republicans just refuse to deal with the same reality that the rest of us are."
"Right! it is better to spend a hundred billion dollars on the army of Ukraine, which is the most corrupt in this region, than to make life easier for the citizens of your country with this money in the crisis created by Biden and the people behind him, while blaming Putin who did everything to prevent the conflict in Ukraine!!! and those people who try to tell the truth about it are persecuted and silenced! you can call it a bot, but that's why it's a democracy."

"Funny how every climate alarmist story that's on the news is told by someone who says "" scientist say..."" or "" climate experts predict..."" but there is never an actual legitimate reputable scientist or climate expert (whatever that actually is) doing any of the talking.

If climate change is real and coal is SOooooo evil......then why is China (one of the worlds largest polluters) allowed to build as many coal refineries as they like?
Hmmmm??
Why are countries like Australia ( who are signed onto the Paris climate accord agreement) still digging millions of tonnes of coal from the ground and selling it to other nations, like China?
But Australia has been ordered to shut down the majority of its coal plants.....which it's doing as we speak.
Australia can't use ""evil coal"", but China can??
Is the atmosphere above China sturdier than any other place on earth?
Or is this hoax all about oil companies shifting their operations into countries that pay workers small change, no superannuation or health benefits, no overtime, no wage rises or worker compensations?

For the elites....it's a win win deal!
And....how's this for some REAL science....According to a NASA study, the gases that make up our atmosphere are Nitrogen 78%, Oxygen 21%, Argon 0.93% and carbon dioxide..........wait for it.............................0.04%.
Yes that's 0.04%, which all of planet earths plant life depend on to survive, and we want to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere?

Looks like we're in trouble!"
"Bullshit.
There's one very good motive for this Co2-global warming scam and this is it:

The global monetary system has come in the greatest crisis ever. In fact all of the system's banks are basically bankrupt.

The central banks have been 'printing' money by huge amounts in the form of buying government bonds. But it's not enough to save the monetary system. Someone came up with a brilliant idea. 'What if the whole world beliefs we have too much Co2 in the atmosphere that drives up temperature and we need huge investments (more debts) to reduce Co2.'' Already governments have policies and international agreements to invest thousands of billions for Co2 reduction. This will rescue the financial system and gear up world economics as it always did, by creating debt with the banks. It is advertised on every tv channel, in every newspaper or magazine, that the world is in great danger because of Co2. It's almost like a holy church. If you don't belief in it, they will call you names like 'extreme right wing populist', 'nationalist', some won't hesitate to even call you a fascist every time you are opposing the doctrine of the climate-church. 

They may call you a 'conspiracy thinker' and the likes. But the truth is, that the financial system ran out of fuel. This happened in history before. Every time it did it was followed by a destructive war and some of these wars cost millions of peoples their lives. If I had to choose between the Co2 scam, or the war, I would choose for the scam. But why didn't we choose to fund the thousands of billions to reduce poverty in the world instead? That would have been a great world wide project too and it wouldn't have taken a dirty scam to refill the banks with debts. Give it a thought. Cheers."
"So when the gravity of Jupiter acts on the Earth's axis adjusting the tilt thereby increasing the northern polar ice cap causing the temperature to drop (say 1.5 degrees Celsius) How much carbon will man have to introduce into the atmosphere from farting cows, burning coal, and operating jets and internal combustion engines to avoid that potential ice age because following the man-made climate change line of reason (so-called) that's how it works (OR maybe man-made climate change is an excuse for a bloated, power hungry government to seize control of the energy and transportation sectors of society which are the beating heart of industry)."

Sorry my friend said that too me and i hate people who don't believe in climate change sooo much"
Interesting how CNN prefers the facts first.
Climate change is a scam
fake news saying something is real is all the proof needed that it is not real.
Okay 1 the facts are so misconstrued its hard to tell if this is even true. 2 CNN are prone to lie about anything just so they can push their personal beliefs and gain. 3 I would do my own research and not take this video in consideration
Not man made
"Man made global warming is a lie and here are the facts...
•  CO2 is a green house gas that is true but its effect are magnified in the models 300 times to get the results needed.  
•  400 PPM is equal to 0.04 % of atmosphere.
• Studies are now finding that higher CO2 levels in the atmosphere are incredible for plants (less fertilizer needed)
•  Temperatures are not rising. Only manipulated data has shown otherwise.
•  Ice core and sea floor samples show CO2 trailing and leading temp changes.
• There has been no sea level rise in the last 20 years.
• Historical data proves massive changes in temperature pre mankind pre industrial revolution.
• The Solar cycle activity and volcanoes causes more changes with temperature than mankind ever could.
• IPCC can’t even prove manmade climate change.
•  Climate Gate and all the lies to make the evidence for manmade climate change.
• The solution Carbon Tax … not a solution just redistribution.

I have recycled and been the best steward to the planet that I could from my early days on. I even have Solar panels on my garage. But when I see someone promoting MMCC like this they lose all credibility. I’m for a clean planet but not a corrupt system."
Humans that hate themselves are the worst of them all
climate change is not by man it is a 450 yearsolar minimum look it up
"What is the role of ionospheric heaters, cancer chemtrails and space travel in man made global warming/triggering the next ice age?"

"Governments should stop trying to control the weather. I can't drive a gas guzzler, but they can shoot radio waves into the clouds in intense continuous bursts. Attempted climate control should be banned. Everyone is worried about cars polluting, but we have how many airplanes zigzagging across our skies. We don't need airplanes, countries would be way better off without them."

No it isn't.
That's it that's me sold its true because CNN one of the most corrupt news organisations in the world says something so it must be true.
I don't see how humans alone have caused this rise if you check the grand spectrum of the temperature of the earth it is completely normal for a 2 degree rise  it's nothing but a pathetic excuse to paint a bad picture on developement and capitalism.
I'm a long time conservative and what I hate is that my side denies the truth.
"Real or not, I don't know but I do know the comment section is unreal for real."
"Taking a minute to educate CNN. There was weather before the late nineteenth century. When you say ""The hottest years on record"" you are leaving out billions of years of weather history."
Ugh. CNN should not advocate for anything of scientific importance. Their name alone casts too much doubt on any position. They should stick to political editorials and stay clear of science.
Global Warming is the governments ways of telling the world they are doing something...... the real immediate threat worldwide is the decline of the BEE population....last year almost 20% less BEE's ...this is significant and could affect the world food order...but that would mean that the governments have to do something (this time for real)....

During the months immediately after France and Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, there was a long interlude with little fighting which was called The Phony War.

We’re feeling the angst of not taking meaningful action, knowing that the battle is unavoidable and is fast approaching, a war in which mankind is its own worst enemy. 
Note: Since we created this mess that we’re in, therein lies the key for victory"

the reporter is talking with scientist or ice data center in this news ?
Jeez it's easy to dupe people into believing some garbage.😂😂😂
"FAKE NEWS : JAJAJA  On July 9, 2021, California’s Death Valley reached 130 degrees Fahrenheit, according to an automated measuring system there, representing one of the highest temperatures ever recorded on the planet. The world record, also recorded at Death Valley, was 134 degrees in July 1913.

More than 210 degrees Fahrenheit separates the highest and the lowest temperatures on record in the United States, the third-largest country in the world. As some states are infamous for having blistering hot summers, others become inundated by winter storms and frigid cold. The contiguous U.S. had its warmest meteorological summer (June-August) on record in 2021, according to NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information.

Stacker consulted 2021 data from the NOAA’s State Climate Extremes Committee (SCEC) to illustrate the hottest and coldest temperatures ever recorded in each state. Each slide also reveals the all-time highest 24-hour precipitation record and all-time highest 24-hour snowfall.

Keep reading to find out your state’s record, or see the national list here.

California by the numbers

 – All-time highest temperature: 134° F (Greenland Ranch on July 10, 1913)
– All-time lowest temperature: -45° F (Boca on Jan. 20, 1937)
– All-time highest 24-hour precipitation: 25.83 inches (Hoegees Fc 60 A on Jan. 22–23, 1943)
– All-time highest 24-hour snowfall: 67 inches (Echo Summit Sierra at Tahoe on Jan. 5, 1982)

Death Valley’s Greenland Ranch holds the record for the highest temperature ever recorded at 134 in 1913. But On Jan. 20, 1937, Boca—a former reservoir located in Nevada County—recorded a mind-numbingly cold temperature of -45 degrees. In February 2019, news reports observed that June Mountain in the Sierra Nevada, located east of Yosemite National Park, reported 72 inches of snow in 24 hours.


Continue below to see the most extreme temperatures in the history of other states in your region.

Arizona by the numbers

– All-time highest temperature: 128° F (Lake Havasu City on June 29, 1994)
– All-time lowest temperature: -40° F (Hawley Lake on Jan. 7, 1971)
– All-time highest 24-hour precipitation: 11.4 inches (Workman Creek 1 on Sept. 4–5, 1970)
– All-time highest 24-hour snowfall: 38 inches (Heber (Black Mesa) Ranger Station on Dec. 14, 1967)

Heber Black Mesa Ranger Station is a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Phoenix and is a ranger district on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests. On Dec. 14, 1967, this part of Arizona suffered from an unexpected natural disaster in the form of a non-stop snowfall that lasted eight days and came to be known as The Blizzard of 1967.


Nevada by the numbers

– All-time highest temperature: 125° F (Laughlin on June 29, 1994)
– All-time lowest temperature: -50° F (San Jacinto on Jan. 8, 1937)
– All-time highest 24-hour precipitation: 7.78 inches (Mt. Charleston Fire Station on Oct. 20, 2004)
– All-time highest 24-hour snowfall: 36 inches (Daggett Pass on Dec. 21, 1996)

Nevada is no stranger to extreme heat. While the hottest day in Nevada was recorded in Laughlin in 1994, in late August 2019, an excessive heat warning was issued to the residents of Las Vegas as the temperature slid up to 110 degrees. Studies show residents will likely be at an increased risk from exposure to extreme heat due to climate change.

BS propaganda.  Need to end the climate change cult!!
Yeah climate change is called spring summer fall and winter you're fake freaking news. All you people are hatemongers. You keep going on the news trying to get everybody to panic it's called spring summer fall and winter there is no climate change stop lying
I don’t see a problem.
Well Dumocrats are going to have to handle china. China has extreme carbon emissions but Dumocrats won't admit it because Dumocrats are in china's payroll. Sad but true
In Canada we’re big fans of warmer weather.

"Greenland was much warmer in the recent and distant past. The Vikings grew barley there, which is impossible now. This is a scare story."
"BREAKING, ICE MELTS IN WARM TEMPERATURES AAAARRRGHH"
Greenland is really going to become a Green land in the next few decades...
Everyone run to the hills.
How do we know what is normal temps other than the past 150 years of temp records. Science says the earth is 4 to 4.5 billion years old. 150 years of empirical data. I don't know what percentage that is but there's a lot of zeroes after that decimal.
People trust politicians over scientists 😂 y’all are crazy
"You people at CNN have a huge agenda , quit trying to scare people with the BS , it’s -72 in central Greenland today , just like glacier national park had to take their signs down about the no more glaciers , guess why there’s glaciers , look on top of MT. Kilimanjaro guess what there is still a ice cap 🤔 same restaurants on the coast havnt had to raise there buildings in the last 64 yrs , concentrate  on real pressing matters about how this president is ruining this country !!!!!!!!!!"
Pack it in folks.   It won't be long now before things decline rapidly.
"Worrying about climate change is a waste. Lets start with controlling illegal drug deaths and alcohol abuse first, they kill many more and are in our control. Stop the lies leftists! I don’t get why the lefties fail to explain how the glaciers sitting on the northern states made a full retreat unless the sun started burning hotter? How do you reverse that dead cold??!"
Of course the ice is melting. We are coming out of an ice age!
I bought a house on the coast of California. My house is across the street where houses are perched on a cliff and are falling in. Looks like I will eventually have my dream come true and have oceanfront property!
Climate change has become a fear mongering hoax.  The climate over 1000s of years has been changing before   human population was minimal.  Total BS
"Remember this is CNN.  Please go to a reputable news organization if you are looking for information on Greenland's ice melting. If you want crap, stay here."
Lots of bots and trolls!
Hahahaha! Fake news! Greenland ice is growing!
Just wondering why we did not stop all sports?  Planes east west north south. Players in hotels. I think all sports should be gone. How’s that climate change people
"Americans be like
""Its good cuz now we can go there on vacation and get a good tan"""
China 🇨🇳 cares ZERO about the Climate do you guys realize that their windmills and solar panels are CONNECTED TO the electrical GRID 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
"We better change everything we do now!   Who cares!  Climate change is the new catch all for anything that happens with the weather.  Drought, to much rain, brutal winter, hot summer, all climate change."
How about we just have the freezer companies just make a bunch of freezers and put them all on the icebergs with the doors propped open? Problem solved!
The Climate Emergency is that Billionaires will take all your rights away.
😂😂😂😂😂
"Holy mackerel, this heat is OFF THE CHARTS🥵🔥 hope that ice doesn't keep defrosting 🥶🥶🥶 otherwise we'll be getting lots of water🌊🌊💦💦🏊🤽🏄🚣"
Excellent !!! More farmland.
Climate change is biggest scam of the century. God said the wisest man on the planet is nothing but a fool. They took core samples 50 years ago in the North Pole and South Pole climate change has been changing throughout the Earth's history. The bank knows it's a scam. Do you think they would lend you money along the coast to build a house if it was going to be underwater in 10 years. No it's a scam two control the people
"Greenland should belong to the USA. We need to give Denmark some money and some preferences. Such a territory should belong only to such a great country as the USA. Take away, like Alaska from Russia.
 And if Denmark is outraged, it is necessary to initiate all efforts to discredit this state. Up to the discovery of weapons of mass destruction in their possession. It is too small and does not have the right to use such a large territory as Greenland."
What is the carbon footprint of a scientific polar expedition?
"We are coming out of an ice age lol? The earth is a planet, the universe is chaotic the world will changeeeeeeee"
"It's gonna be very difficult for us, mostly young people"
In summer there a just a few months of melt.  Only a few the rest of the year it freezing cold and gaining mass.   Its not fecin melting all the time stop the scaremongering.
Good. The ice came from the ocean so it melts back into the ocean. Nothing new here

Yeah this is about as concerning as the ice melting in my scotch and soda. 🙄
"My 5 cents analysis has shown that the disintegrated plastics in the oceans traps heat and contributes significantly to the increase in ocean temperatures..!

Further, the micro-plastics now forms part of the new ice  at the poles these last 50 years or so...! 
These new ice have the propensity to melt faster with the presence of micro-plastics...! 

The presence of micro-plastics in the snow, ice and in the water absorbs & retains  more  solar heat...!

The contributio  of micro-plastics everywhere in the environment has undeniably, a more significant effect on global warming...!

CHEERIO...! 🙏 ❤️"
"The human primate is undoubtedly the most brilliant of any animal species but at the same time, it is also the most profoundly stupid. No other animal consciously destroys the very environment it is dependent upon for survival, except for the human. In our ignorant quest to destroy the planet, we are also causing the elimination of millions of other animal and plant species. Earth is currently in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. The previous extinctions, mostly attributed to climate change, killed an estimated 75% to 96% of all living things."

We Pilipino peoples will still drink coffee even in summer on past years.. but now.. we cant even stay inside our own house in noon due to heat..
"Can anyone articulate the international transition plan to convert from fossil fuel to electric power? 

Studies from MIT and private organizations have identified the current infrastructure cannot support the future electric energy demand, and projected wind and solar technologies are incapable of bridging the energy gap. 

Hardest question is: How do we get Russia and China onboard?  Without their full cooperation our efforts will only delay the inevitable. Are we, as a world population, willing to expend the resources necessary to effect regime change in these countries?  

Also understand there are nearly 200 coal-fired power stations under construction in Asia, including 95 in China, 28 in India and 23 in Indonesia, according to data from U.S. nonprofit Global Energy Monitor (GEM).

Grid protection against cyber-attack, physical attack, and electromagnetic pulse are other concerns.  Do we have a plan to protect our energy generation and transmission capabilities from these threats?

Nuclear power is probably a thing of the past and hydro-electric generation is significantly constrained by environmental issues and drought conditions; what other sources of electricity generation can we expect? 

Do we have a plan for the safe and environmentally sound disposal of spent batteries from these vehicles and other devices once they’ve reached the end of their useful life?"

But the ice sheets at the north pole have grown continuously since the ice minimum in 2012 to almost the size of 1979. That gives me hope
"I just read an article from these so called experts that said over the last century the ice has melted 1.3 miles per day.
Do the math and see how these idiots are lying."
"I believe it's already too late, within 20 or 30 years, millions of  people will probably be dying from heat. The Earth doesn't care if we live or die. In every house there is a thermostat or there should be. When it gets too cold, a heater kicks in when it gets too hot the AC kicks in. Our Earth is a fantastic place, and I believe our Earth has a thermostat of sorts. Our thermostat that has over eons prevented our Earth from being just a giant ice ball in space, has volcanoes. Right now all around the globe volcanoes and volcanic activity is ramping up. Ash in the Earth's atmosphere can actually cool the planet. However the amount that's going on now is nowhere near enough to make a difference. Yellowstone supervolcano has earthquakes that are ramping up they call them drum beat earthquakes. Yellowstone supervolcano has been recharging and while sensors have been trying to read the amount of magma refilling the giant caldera in many cases it can't even be picked up on the sensors because it is doing what is known as screaming. That happens when the magma comes in so fast that it cannot be picked up by sensors. If Yellowstone erupts it will be a cataclysmic event. The amount of Ash will cause tremendous devastation and much death. However it will send an ash cloud around the globe cooling down our earth and the mountains will be covered with snow and ice again IF it erupts and IF it is a full eruption. If it doesn't happen soon, can you imagine 130°f ? That's when we all start dying and that's where we are going. Just look at the temperatures over the last 10 years. Enjoy life now."
20 years from now when in a lot of the world it will be really difficult to find drinkable water we will regret not catching this water that comes from this ice as it flows into the sea.
Not concerned// this is god job
😂😂😂
Carbon is just 1 of many gases that make up a total of .1% of the atmosphere. They have gone too far with these lies....
"STOP with the lie of climate change! CO2 molecules are heavier than O2, N, & Ar, the 3 main gases that make up our atmosphere. It is IMPOSSIBLE for it to rise into the atmosphere. If it could rise no trees or plants would live....stop spreading the lies. They have gone too far with this one, too many people know better"
"Even more concern...

Truth the glaciers are melting and will kill most species including people when they flood the world
Bull crap.  Water is water:  It has the same specific volume whether its in a solid or liquid state.  Every glacier on earth could melt and it wouldn't raise the sea level a fraction of an inch.  More socialist propaganda.  Back in the 1970s these same Chicken Littls said we were headed for an ice age.  Agenda-driven lies.
"Just imagine a world without change. EVERYTHING goes in cycles. If you care to review history of the Earth, not humans, it cycles hot to hotter, to cold and colder. This is why we have parts of the earth that are desert that were once tropical jungles. Stop and think, it isn't just humans, it is the way of everything. If humans are so intelligent why can't they figure that out. Humans are worried about the sea level rising and the drought destroying the lands. Stop, think, why don't humans build desalination plants along the shore lines and send the water to those areas in dire need of water. Oh, pardon me that would be intelligent, which despite their claims humans seem to lack."

"Since the 1600s, Greenland ice sheet accumulation rates have increased. The estimated mean accumulation rate in the most recent 170 years (1840–2009) is 30% greater than the estimated mean accumulation rate in the 410 years since 1600"
Time to build those ships as seen in the movie 2012. I am going to China.
There goes Mara largo !   Too bad Donnie.
"just like they pipe oil to other parts of the world, could they not pipe water to places in the world that need it? could use tanker ships until they get the pipes sorted out."

Comment
Highest temp USA 1919 any? S
Maybe he should should himself.
Delusional
"1963, hahahaha!"
Why would anyone think it's not acceptable to ask is something is right?
"So how does he respond to Profs. Lindzen (MIT), Happer (Princeton), Christie (Huntsville) and others who go, (a) the satellite data says the temp hasn't gone up as much as you're saying. Have you checked your thermometers aren't being affected by urban sprawl? (b) our plants are LOVING it because they evolved to eat much higher levels of CO2 than we have now (we pump it in at 1000 ppm to greenhouses because that's what they like). (c) CO2 levels have been MUCH higher in the past (2,000 ppm when brachiosaurus was stomping about) and the world survived. It was at 7,000 ppm when our fossil fuels were laid down. How about the  NOAA's own ice core samples that show we go through periods of warming and cooling, and peak warming every 100,000 years or so (we're just over 100,000 years since the last one)? How does he justify plunging the west, responsible for less than 50% of CO2 emissions (which are greening the planet. China and Asia, plus developing countries being helped by China, account for over 50%) into economic disaster, with its associated starvation, suicides, riots and revolutions over something that happens regularly, and that we cannot stop even if it WAS our fault because the biggest 'polluters' won't play ball (India calls it eco-colonialism. Frankly, I'm with them). 

Is the temp rising? Yes. It does that. Every 100,000 years or so, it goes very high. Then it drops down to around -3 to -4. The last one (just over 100,000 years ago) was the Eemian. 100,000 years before that we had La Bouchet, 100,000 before that Purfleet, and 100,000 before that the Hoxnian. It happens, it's predictable. We need to focus not on stopping it, but on steeling ourselves to deal with it because even if we stopped (everyone, including China, Asia, etc) producing CO2 tomorrow, the temp with STILL go up. We also need to find a reliable power source that can work in subzero temps, because that's what comes next. Wind and solar will not cut it.

CO2 is 0.04% of the 1% of GHGs. Of that over 96% is entirely natural (plants and animals breathing, evaporation from the oceans, volcanic activity, etc). Man is responsible for less than 4% of 0.04% of 1%. If the Earth were SO sensitive that it would burn up if we carry on, it would have burned to a crisp when Krakatoa went boom in 1882. It didn't. The Earth can cope. It IS coping by growing more plants (which are feeding the people, so win-win).

Bottom line. The threats to the farmers (Eire told they must slaughter 200,000 cattle, farmers across Europe told they must stop growing food, stop using fertilizers and generally stop running efficient farms) has led to outcry because we all know that if they stop, we starve. They're telling us to get rid of our cars and shift to electric, but the grid couldn't cope if we COULD do that, and most of us are too broke thanks to the cost of heating and fuel right now. We're poor and we're starting to get very, VERY angry. 

Most of the alarmist stuff is coming from one model, RCP 8.5. They put figures we know from 50 years ago into RCP 8.5 and asked it to tell us the weather today. We're all, apparently, dead. Of all the models, RCP 2.4 (I think) is the lowest and most accurately aligns with reality, but it's not scary, so they don't use it for the press briefings. There's only so long you can keep crying wolf. Stop funding this idiocy and you'd be amazed how fast the fearmongering goes down. I've seen papers on how diabetes is responsible for the obesity epidemic (as opposed to stupid amounts of cheap sugar in the food and sedentary lifestyles) and diabetes. Say ANYTHING is caused by climate change, and you'll get published, even if it's utter rubbish. This has got to stop. Use the trillions being pushed into this into defences against rising sea levels, research into genuine alternatives to fossil fuels (which WILL run out one day, and we need something we can turn on and off to accommodate peaks in demands. You can't do that with a nuclear power station!), and ways to keep people cool because we're going to need it, but stop saying we're going to turn into Venus. We simply won't. We're not close enough to the sun, we have MUCH more water than that planet ever had, and Earth has been through this MANY times before."
"It's interesting how 100 million years ago there was 5 to 10 times as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and yet plant and animal life was larger in size and more abundant. The temperature was fine for life, nothing was drowning from rising sea levels, and there were many ice ages since then."
I though tyson was more clever ill stop listening to him it seems like is on a payrolls
guy who's not a climate scientist telling us about climate science and hurricanes = man made climate change
no one on the news ever lies.  celebrities are trustworthy.  it is a good sign for our society that we are turning “scientists” into celebrities.
That brought out those who are dismissive of climate science.
wow. that didn't age well.
"It’s been nearly 40 years, still waiting for the 30 foot sea level rises promised by Al Goose Gore of the global warming religion. But then again he owns a beachfront property."
"Regarding his claim the science is ""settled"" that is discredited by a basic look at the facts. A climate model that goes out to the year 2100 cannot be fully tested until the year 2100, so it cannot be settled at present. So already the claim the science is ""settled"" has been discredited."
"The thing NDT is missing is the science is attaching itself to an intended policy outcome, and no matter how many research papers scientists put out there, they can never order the public to adopt their policy prescriptions because of our system of government. Policy comes from the legislature, elected by the people at large, not scientists. Scientists are not respecting that. They seem to think the voters are required to take orders from them just because they throw their academic weight around."
"The man complains about cherry picking in science, then proceeds to make an argument based on one cherry picked weather event..."
He should be the next president of the United States.
The great problem is: there are too many climate experts. Now everybody speaks of it as if they knew everything about it.
"He just described the global warming scam, his religion."
"This guy doesn’t believe in two genders, so he’s completely wrong on “Climate change”!🖕🏻"
Tyson is an arrogant blowhard. Bonhoeffer's theory of stupidity incarnate. What a dummy.
Neil Disgrace Tyson. Climate alarm is all about cherry picking and propaganda. Politicized science is not science. Don't listen to the Climate alarm witch doctors. With all due respect to witch doctors.
"""The energy budget of this system involves the absorption and reemission of about 200 watts per square meter. Doubling CO2 involves a 2% perturbation to this budget. So do minor changes in clouds and other features, and such changes are common. In this complex multi-factor system, what is the likelihood of the climate (which, itself, consists in many variables and not just globally averaged temperature anomaly) is controlled by this 2% perturbation in a single variable? Believing this is pretty close to believing in magic. Instead, you are told that it is believing in ‘science.’ Such a claim should be a tip-off that something is amiss. After all, science is a mode of inquiry rather than a belief structure."" - Richard Lindzen, MIT atmospheric science professor and lead author of Chapter 7, ""Physical Climate Processes and Feedbacks,"" of the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Third Assessment Report on climate change."
So we should do what?  Shut 1/3 off the economy so civilization can collapse?  Poor countries don’t give a shit about climate change cause their people are starving.
"Tyson is so cute, dramatic, animated. I love what he says, but also seeing him say it. He could be in one of those old movies.. Except he's too smart and is needed right where he is."
"Well considering this man is unable to recognise a male, or female, I'm disinclined to believe much of what he says. 

Yes, you absolutely ask: is the science right - humans have always got the application of science wrong before we got it right."
This guy is a major puppet

Self awareness isn't Neils strong suite. Nothing is settled and climate science is Government funded.
"Seems a pretty fair debate , explaining why the person who is not in the room, is wrong ."
"There has always been climate change and there allways will be. The sea level went up more than 120 m the last 20,000 years. And there are still many meters to go. The politically driven and cherry picking corporative owned media and scientists like we see here are a big problem. With their one and only message: ""You did it. So pay more taxes and we will solve it."" It's time to focus on the real problem called environmental pollution and destruction., so we can really do something about it."
If we still listened only to the scientific consensus... we will think that the Sun circles the Earth.
A astrophysicist with an opinion on everything lecturing us
Clown thinks men can get pregnant.  Lol
there was a min ice age in the 1400s   it will happen again!    it will happen again!   the planet is going to get very cold again!
Climate change is caused by sun spots!  You can make the planet as green as you can imagine....  ohhh like it was before the industrial revolution... and the sun spots will still cause climate change!  i get you want to keep the air clean.. etc but there is a limit!     the last ice age was 10k or so ago!     mark my words
What a crock
NDT is a perfect example of social promotion.
"This was extremely critical 6 years ago
But not enough has been done since
It is even more important now that 6 years have passed 
But with all that has been done,
why haven’t things changed in the positive 
In other words, you said it was critical, many things were done to slow the causes, but nothing has improved 
So either you were wrong, or your ideas about how to fix were wrong.
Either way sounds like we need better people on this"
"Somebody who thinks 50"" of rain in Houston is unprecedented, or that a huricane the width of Florida going up the center of Florida is proof of manmade climate change, knows nothing of climate science.  Nothing.   First of all, Atlantic huricane energy, frequency and severity are all untrended.  Untrended.  Houston see's torrential rainfall like that at least once, usually twice per century."
Science is not consensus and Neil was NEVER a good scientst.  He was simply a good student of Astrophysics and an eloquent speaker who checked the right boxes.  Science is not consensus and climate science is in its infancy.  They cannot skillfully predict climate change at this time.
John Stossel Youtube...dr Judith Curry..omg
"The Ice caps have increased, Plants love more CO2 people like warmer weather..the Caribou have increased
More climate cult garbage this time by deGrasse"
It rained so what? ..so what about the SHOCK of the decrease of Hurricanes for the last decade?
"Mr. Tyson, Lincoln was  not alive in 1963!  It's true that 97% of climate scientists, who are receiving climate change study grants, agree that ""climate change"" is real.  Oh wait, hasen't the climate ALWAYS BEEN CHANGING, huh, Chicken Little?  I guess I will suffer you, but NOT GLADLY. I am only a lowly retired Sr. EE, so my climate position probably doesn't matter.  However, regardless of your title, I have lost all respect for you!  Shalom/gw. PS When has there ever been a data driven open debate on the issue. From all I can tell even the suggestion of such an event drives the climate alarmists into a screaming frenzy.  What are they afraid of?  Me thinks they doth protest too much!"
"I believe in empirical evidence and the evidence is being manipulated by politicians because when you politicise science it's no longer science it's PROPAGANDA and that's where we are and the scientists that receive funding follow the political narrative in order to receive continued funding, what amazes me is the number of pseudo intellectuals who spout this nonsense without checking the empirical evidence because if you do, like I did we are being lied to by vile politicians hellbent on destroying ""TRUTH"" and replacing it with their truth & their agenda & instilling fear as a distraction for monetary gain, want to know what the future holds, go visit China a fearful misinformed public that's forced to repeat whatever government ""LIE"" as TRUTH. I'm not fearful of climate change I'm fearful of a government that no longer represents its people & blatantly lies while forcing a narrative completely alien to eager MSM channels espousing the same unified lie with such fervour & hatred to all who oppose it."
SCIENCE IS NEVER SETTLED GET IT IN YOUR RETARDED SKULLS CNN ANCHORBOY
DEGRASSE TYSON IS A CLOWN
"Weather prediction , temperature 🌡 , rain 🌧 , wind , and everything else are some of the most difficult equations of all , super-computers were invented for the porpuse , and still , they promise about 50% accuracy , so when someone says that they know how the weather is going to be in the next decade , it's truly ridiculous , but I don't know , as any theory scientists work on , hopefully advanced satellites and quantum computers using AI can get us there , some say birds can detect the weather better than anyone ! you simply cannot consider all of the factors , it's an organic mess of creative chaos that somehow led us to this stable and growing eco-system , thus far , the eco system has been quite good at self stabilisation , and it'd be nice if we helped it ! With human technology , we can water deserts and start up a new eco system there , but still , some people ven say that geo maps proved that the Sahara desert in Africa and the amazon jungle in South America have an inverse relation because of rain clouds and wind paths ! 😳🤯 LOL ! Then also , I don't think humanity can ever surpass Vulcanos in toxic gasses emissions , so much black carbon and Sulfur and acid rain ! And yet people say these disasters give rebirth to eco systems , and have the most fertile soil ! We should avoid nuclear war , we should plant more , we should avoid toxic chemicals , we should build more canals and lakes and damns to collect water to house all forms of life , and we should keep studying , loving and living with nature !"
"Neil fails in this because consensus doesnt make something truth, the consensus in the past was that earth was central, some people got killed because of it, but turned out they were right the sun is the center piece of our system not our planet, this just a small simple example that consensus doesnt mean absolutely anything, if you have proof you dont even need to make a consensus you can just prove it, sadly great minds of our time are kept on a leash and ordered around by the elite, irresponsible is to make any decision at all based solely on consensus."
"Neil deGrasse is still proving to this day that he is a disgrace to science.  Water levels rising faster than our ability to respond.  What a joke.  Go look at the data.  Does he really not know what historical sea level rise rates are?  The sea level is rising at the sam,e rate as it was 100 years ago.  Models predict they will accelerate in rise rates but they have been doing this for 40 years and it hasn't happened."
"Okay, for all you folks wondering where the truth lies, it isn't here. Listen to, read, study all the arguments on both sides of the debate and you will quickly learn a few things:
1. The ""climate change is real"" folks like Dr. Tyson never present empirical data, they just ridicule the ""deniers."" Ask yourself why that might be. He talks about cherry picking and he cherry picks a major storm and rising seas when the data shows no statistical increase in storms over the last 100 years, and the worst case scenario IPCC prediction is 12 - 18 inches of sea level rise by 2100, and they just came out that their worst case scenario is highly unlikely. And Dr. Tyson thinks we have to move cities inland? Seriously? He's never heard of Holland? (who by the way are helping Bangladesh prepare just in case)
2. There are no deniers. None of the serious scientists questioning the climate narrative deny our contribution to CO2 levels. They differ on the seriousness of the situation and the best response.
3. The ""deniers"" will always present empirical data and lots of it to support their arguments. Why might that be? Think it through, challenge it, listen to both sides and,
4. You will finally realize the world is not going to end. The problem is manageable and will be managed."
the problem is normal people do not even know how science works. most of the people here probably remember nothing of science class. they dont even understand the idea of experiments being replicable
"After an estimated 8.5 billion years the Earth is in dire straights, man and his lust for life has rendered the Earth uninhabitable. The Earth has withstood Asteroid strikes, ice ages, nuclear blasts, famine, and countless wars, but the Earth has had enough.  In just a few short years  Climate change will do what the other stuff couldn't do. destroy the earth, or make the earth unlivable.  There is no time to waste  It is up to this generation to save the earth at all costs. 🧿you are the chosen one"
Yeah. Let us not forget that it was the scientific community that told us that a fetus growing in a mother's womb is not a baby! LOL!!
"Tyson is a supercilious,arrogant scold who has no excuse for being this stupid.I would have imagined a physicist who had spent any time at all studying the Planck and Schwartzchild papers on black body radiation would understand how silly this government induced hoax really is"
This guy is a planetarium operator
Pfizer v@xx pusher too. ID 10 T
So correlation proves causation ?  Dude is a fool as he has proven recently talking @bout the trans issue
"Why doesn't he convince us that mankind is causing the climate change? Him stating that there is unprecidented rainfall and hurricanes is NOT proof that humans are CAUSING these changes. Come on Dr. Tyson, you are an incredibly talented teacher - teach us!!!!"
9 out of 10 doctors prefer Camel cigarettes 😂😂
No such thing as climate change God's in change.  Read your Bible he created this planet for us.
So eloquently put 👌
"Tyson is a climate change propagandist. Here he links a hurricane to manmade climate change. But the IPCC AR6 Chapter 11 (Extreme Weather) (published 2021) which represents the 'concnsenus' he claims to support states regarding tropical storms (= hurricanes)  ""There is low confidence in observed long-term trends in frequency or intensity. No change in observed numbers of landfall hurricanes in USA since 1900."" That is a direct quote. So it is TYSON who is making up the 'science'."
"Yes climate shift is real. But they like to leave out that natural climate shift has a lot of extra factors. Like the planets orbital shifts, change in axis tilts over time, sun radiation phases, cosmic radiation, and also the internal geology changes of earths crust and core and landmass shifting that alters ocean and wins patters.

So yes, but theres a lot of details in what the hell goes into the totality of climate change"
"Neil is a schill and a dummy. His IQ is 123. He isn't, and never will be, the village wise man. He doesn't even work in his own field. He is the dummy that talks about other peoples work. He literally pointed to weather systems as evidence of climate change. He is worse than old people that ""can't remember it being this hot in the summer"" therefore climate change. He has never presented any data that hasn't been proven to be wrong, so like other pushers of climate crisis, they deflect from facts by citing a ""consensus"" that has also been debunked."
"We know one thing for certain, that the climate has always changed and always will.  
The Sarha desert used to be fertile grassland.  Yet without fossil fuel emissions, it became the largest desert in the world. 
For the sake of discussion, let's just say that man-made climate change is inarguably true and is helping the natural process of the earth's ever-evolving climate move along.
Al Gore, our very own Climate Change Czar, has publically said that the US could go to zero emissions tomorrow and it would not change a thing, as most of the pollution comes from China and third-world countries.  China is currently building on average two new coal plants every single week. 
Which begs the question. 
What the hell are we doing?
 Why are we spending trillions on green energy such as electric cars,  the vast majority of which are charged with energy generated by fossil fuels in the first place?
Not to mention the rare earth minerals needed to build the batteries that are used in the cars are for the most part under the control of China and mined by children using slave labor.
In the big picture of time,  have been on this earth for a blink of an eye. 
With us or without us the climate will eventually change.  
We should focus our attention on keeping the air and water as clean as we can manage using scrubbing technologies on car exhausts among other things but it is a fallacy for us to believe that if we all owned electric cars by 2035 it would save the planet."
"Thats all great but what should the west do?  You want us to further burder our economy, make us uncompetitive in manufacturing again, and further add to our enormous debt while doing nothing about China, India, et. al., who get a pass.  There is an adjacent, hidden, anti-American, anti-west, anti-capitalism agenda that you're being a useful idiot cheerleader for.  Talk about these aspects if you want credibility."
How much Tyson got paid to buy this climate change crap?
"Besides being an arrogant, obnoxious person, his views on CC are asinine. Yes, Man has upward pressure on temps BUT effect is miniscule vs Natural Factors. CO2 is 0.04% of Earth's atmosphere. A colorless, odorless, non-toxic gas that helps green the planet"
Neil has become a grifter and a fraud!
"He did a huge talk about how america is falling HARD in terms of science and allowing disinformation to rule over settled science that has hundreds or thousands of years of data and study behind it just to be debunked as ""fake and woke"" because some idiot on a youtube video in a position of power not at all relating to science and has the IQ of a stale piece of bread says ""climate change doesn't exist."""
"Bravo for telling the truth about ""general factsa and truth in science"" and clearly explaining EXACTLY what I have been telling al these plain STOOOPIC doubters 
who find one or two examples of the 2 or 3 % malfeasance by some outlier 'scientist' or even organization then SEIZE on that as how to base ALL policy. or worse
Declaring to the world, ""See , I TOLD you it was wrong."". Example: They keep on babbling about Biden's son and his father ""spoke to him n Ukraine"" as the reason
to upset the ENTIRE American multi Trillion economic power, overlooking the myriad faults and lies of our last President. his 2 impeachments and 
80+ Criminal indictments  and some how conjure up these as 'Oh it's equivalent'.  That is scientific total blindness~ 
Jay Leno was right- it's ""Dumbmerica"""
Neil.....how in Gods name can you separate the fact that science has become as much a bussiness as the oil industry is....you bloody well know that....so whos interests are we really talking about here?? Who??
Did Neil say Abraham Lincon signed in 1963????? Really???
deGrasse has already trashed himself. His women employees do not belong to him.
We live in a world of extremes. Both sides refuse to admit that they both may be right and wrong. Each side must be 100% right. THAT is the issue.
How many times must we explain the obvious t self imposed ignorance?
"If consensus were to be the litmus test for what is true in science then we would still be deferring to Galen in medicine and maintaining that the earth is the center of the universe.  The only problem with consensus is that the studies from academics nowadays has been so poorly managed that people cannot trust the research.  

“What is the cost of lies? It’s not that we’ll mistake them for the truth. The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all.”  -- Chernobyl"
I am concerned that Climate Change is being confused with weather events.  Climate change is based on CO2 levels in ice cores over 100's of thousands of years.  We then infer temperatures based on those CO2 levels or tree ring size.  We are nowhere close to forecasting extreme weather based on climate change models.
"Has anyone mentioned that Climate change has the most effect below +/- 30 degrees latitudes due to the Coriolis effect?  The rotation vector at the equator is horizontal to the surface of the earth.  The rotation vector at the poles are vertical to the surface of the earth.  This means a 1.5 degree increase adds to the temperatures at the equator, but not the poles of our planet.  Therefore climate controlled greenhouse gases are effective at our equator.  The temperature at the poles of our earth are controlled mainly by hydrodynamics."
This guy proves that he is a moron every time he opens his mouth. Definitely an affirmative action recipient.
Bill Nye if Tucker Carlson let him cook:
Another climate emergency hoax clown.
Abraham Lincoln in 1963😂 didn’t know he was a conspiracy nut
the problem with people like this is  because they have spent a lot of time in schools and colleges and universities they believe what the establishment tell them without question. They are clever from a learning point of view but are not smart enough to question anything on a singular level. if you check this guy out you will see he is just a paid WEF puppet.
"Reactionaries & reactionary leaders have been battling against science since before the Catholic Church put Galileo on trial for heresy, for stating that the Earth orbited the sun. The lines are always drawn the same way, too: reactionaries vs. facts. Scopes Monkey Trial, Moon Landing conspiracy theories, global warming denial, anti-vaxxers; they're all of a piece. 30% of the U.S. population will remain unconvinced on the day it kills them, as we have recently seen with COVID. They cannot be helped to understand because they WON'T understand. This kind of ignorance is a choice & they've made it.

We were told about global warming by our 5th grade teacher in the mid-1960's & she presented it as a THEORY, giving equal time to a counter-theory that posited initial warming would generate heavy winter snowfalls & bring on another Ice Age instead. ALL of this was originally based on the rising CO2 levels generated by human industrial & transportation activity, which were then already a measurable & accepted fact among scientists. Now, we get to argue over what facts are....."
Watching politicians cherry-pick science to come up with policy is scary enough...before you realize that most of the degreed politicians doing this are lawyers who haven't paid any attention to science since middle school. If then. Then there are the non-degreed politicians like Bo-Bo Boebert...
"Science is NOT based on consensus.  It is based on indisputable facts.  Billions of humans have lived and died believing the Earth was flat.  Also, 100 scientists ridiculed Einstein's Theory of Relativity.  They were all WRONG.  Our climate has been changing since this planet was formed 4.3 billion years ago.  C02 is plant food and a weak green-house gas.   The average temperature was 7C warmer for the past 600 million years.  The real question is if human produced C02 is causing a climate crisis?  Show us facts.  Watch     https://youtu.be/vVi01vJ4nxM  How Climate Science got hijacked by Alarmists."
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/t-Lep2vT1gs
And this was 5 years ago... have we continued to delay?
"How someone can have such evolved, nuanced thoughts and yet never come across as preachy or arrogant is truly amazing."
The science is far from settled unless you want totalitarian world government
Tyson says there are more than 2 genders and that proves scientists can be bought
"The 'Safe and Effective - Take the Shot or Die' abusive narcissistic deGrasse spewing incoherent drivel about CO2 once again. Meanwhile the AGW hypothesis has never been proven or demonstrated with real world data and observable evidence. Pointing out changes in the environment, claiming CO2 did it and demanding more money to stop it is a criminal fraud only a crooked scientists and politician could believe. Money grubbing monsters, where there are pigs there are troughs."
Comment
"All you fucking democratic liars are nothing but 🐷 bastards, your lying about climate change and our food."
"The concept that we can change our climate is only used to help someone make money.  It's ridiculous! Government is affecting our food, milk $5+ a gallon Butter 5+ for 2 cups. Because they are taking away our cows in the name of climate change they are working on starving people or making them all poor."
"You don't think it might be something to do with a) contrails, or b)wars, bombs, missile testing, weather experiments? No? Just cars then 🙄"
"Farting is affecting your life, drinking is affecting your life, eating is affecting your life, breathing is affecting your life.....here is how....The insanity of the left knows no boundaries. I fully support abortion up to the age of 18 starting with liberals and their parents."
Climate change is the religion of the left.

YIP and my question would be Bill Gates buying all the family farms famine is coming ? the soviet union made was to use a central committee can never manage a family farm as well as a family because they been there 100 years and they know the piece of dirt. Are going back to the English times where only the rich eats and the rest goes hingry JOE BIDEN LOST CONTROL OF INFLATION
"🤦more carbon dioxide means bigger plants…because the carbon makes up the majority of the plant… I’d doesnt mean less of other minerals in the plant…  rice is low in some minerals(like zinc), so a diet composed of almost only rice will cause deficiencies, because they likely only have access to rice for food. Apparently they’ve been breeding varieties that have more of certain minerals like zinc. This whole argument that CO2 is causing less nutritious food is completely insane. It makes no sense biologically…. If the CO2 levels we have caused are having real impacts on the planet, then why is this ridiculous story a thing? It doesn’t help the argument at all, in fact it does the opposite.."

"Well over 10 years ago the majority of the American people understood the importance of heeding what scientists were reporting and that we needed to begin taking steps. The corporations used disinformation and denial campaigns to block legislation, to protect megaprofits and their growing wealth. Just think, if the Popular Vote - the will of the nationwide majority of voters - decided our elections, steps would have been taken in behalf of public safety, LONG ago. The only reason nothing has been done yet is because of the Electoral College, the means by which corporate oligarchs lock up our voting system with big, FAT money. We need to get a real democracy going to catch up with the 21st century.                                                                                                                       https://news.yahoo.com/climate-change-could-lead-to-global-catastrophe-new-report-warns-143247714.html?.tsrc=jtc_news_index"
I love see Elizabeth Warren coming out of her private plane.
Straight GMO corn n soy is what America produces. You think it bother these farmers care how they got to do it a big NO cause it’s all about money. It wasn’t just climate before n now it is so it’s going to happen that we will need to grow our own food hope we reach that point cause if not big food companies will own us as already they do. We are at the mercy of suppliers
"What does 2020 have in store for us on the climate change denial front? What media doesn't mention enough is that the corporations and all its shills know and have ALWAYS known the reality of climate change. That it's a win-win for corporatists to deny it thru its propaganda campaigns - at our long-term expense, in money and lives - as oligarchs laugh their way to the bank, living for the moment, figuring ""this is a problem for future generations, why should WE give a shit?"" Once the manifestations of climate change are bare enough, they'll change their tactics and say, ""hey, we have all this exploitable terrain now! New places to drill for oil that were previously unreachable!"" The warming Arctic climate and summer shrinkage of the iced area has attracted the attention of many countries, such as China and the United States, toward the top of the world, where resources and shipping routes may soon be exploitable.That's all they care about, while poor and middle class people in different parts of the world face uncertain catastrophe."
It's all the GMOs and hormones the same government let's us eat everyday and spray us with Chemtrails that are getting in our soil. Why don't you look into all the heavy metals planes dump on our land daily!  MORE CNN PROPAGANDA!
"NOBODY belives in climate change, stop the charade."
"I love how ignorant everyone is, he's doing an experiment to see how the levels of carbon dioxide in our air will effect plants in the future. there's no way the weather goes through three cycles every year, this isn't the Avatar. the whole point is that climate change is fucking up consistent weather patterns, learn about it."
why are we not talking about population? There should be no countries with 1 billion people. We are in the 21st century headed to robotizing everything the rich can so why add more people to earth? We are the reason for climate change.

Fact: plants at night take in oxygen and let out co2 just like any other living organism
Fact: leftists love to make big issues about things they have no answer to."
CNN  spreads left wing misinformation on climate change!
"If you want to know the results of ""climate change studies"", just go to the source of the funding and look at their political views. No ""funder"" is going to shell out money for a ""study"" that ends up going against their own political views. It isnt rocket science. This is why for every group of scientists saying one thing, you can find just as many to discredit it. When you make it political, you make a mockery of the ""scientists"" who are pawns to the funding."
"When Yellowstone blows you won't have to worry about climate change and all the trillions of dollars your tryin to spend  on tryin to take the carbon out of the air, It won't change the fact that the poles naturally change and there is no way to stop tectonic plates from moving causing earthquakes and volcanos erupting which cause carbon levels to sky rocket not to mention nuclear (as they call them) winters. Not to mention the Sulphur acid the volcano produces and puts in the water, all that money spent gone in a matter of days in reality. Enjoy it while you still have sunshine nothing lasts forever, and history shows us that's a fact."
*STOP LEAF DECAY NOW*
"i think that if people decreased usage of anything that would generate  more carbon dioxide and planted more trees and cut down less trees that in time we would have enough trees creating 0xygen that we could be able to take out most of the worlds carbon dioxide leaving us with healthy plants to grow and so that the world would not flood andd die out but all of this could only happen if there was some president that really about the world dying or a new law that passed out though the world.



btw trump if you wont do anything about global warming then for the love of everything that is good give yourself a good haircut for once you half bald-headed yellow haired piece of crap"
"If we do not use fossil fuels (Oil & Natural Gas) before the Tectonic Plates push the Oil & Natural Gas into the volcanoes who in turn will spew Green House gasses into the upper atmosphere like a Mega Diesel engine at one time.

And of course no renewable electric watt can replace it.

"CLIMATE  CHANGE  IS  FAKE  NEWS  FOR  STUPID  GULLIBLE  PEOPLE  
ALSO  KNOWN  AS  FUCKWITS"
"CLIMATE  CHANGE  FRAUD
ITS  WHAT  THE  GOVERNMENTS  ARE  SPRAYING  IN  THE  ATMOSPHERE"
"Fake news, fake science, fake concern."
What matters at the end is money and how to get rich
"No matter how much damage corrupt government officials and corrupt CEOs do today, Mother Nature will always win in the long run. 

Yes, human greed and incompetence may cause the extinction of more species, but other species will fill the void and this may be after a major die-off of the human population. Mother Nature always wins in the end. A human life is short. The life of a nation is a bit longer. The life of the planet is very long."
"""Ban meat""

"Here I found that many stupid, ass, ignorant people disliked this video. And all those inhuman, uneducated, donkeys commented here in reverse.. And they all are idiot @Trump's Fan. 
These People (who didn't understand about climate change and global warming. And they all are Fucking Trump's Fan) are the harmful germs of the earth that will slowly destroy this beautiful earth......"
"The head of agriculture for the United States is literally TELLING YOU that climate change is BS yet you still believe the media's lies about it.


Seems legit."
GMOs and pesticides not global warming.
Basically diabetes for plants.
"Snap out of it zombies

Climate change is a communist hoax pushed to secure more intrusion into and control over our daily lives

Fact

The world will suffer from a cataclysmic end not from global warming. History proves that."
"It's a complete waste of time and energy protesting and rallying for climate change. As long as big business keeps making money on gasoline, oil, coal, fossil fuels, etc., nothing will change one bit. The damage has already been done and nothing at this point would correct the damage done."
Stop chemtrailing.
This is highly misleading.  CO2 does not make food junkier.  It makes it more nutritious.
"Could it be the fact that like O2 organisms, there is a sweet spot +- , for Carbon dioxide organisms? For humans its 19.5 - 23.5 oxygen, outside that sweet spot, we die..."
OBEDIENT FOOLS -CHERNOBYL
Why aren’t you in India and China and protesting them to change?
"The world is adding another billion people every 12-14 years.  The earth cannot sustain that population growth without disastrous effects.  The amount of deforestation required to create farmland to feed the livestock and humans changes the ratio of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and strains water resources.  The energy, food, and water requirements of another billion people is too much.  Humans will breed us into extinction.  The world leaders must prioritize a public awareness campaign to have families limit offspring to two children just to get to a zero population growth.  Asia and Africa are the worst offenders while the modern world is already getting close to an average of 2 children.  Family planning education is required worldwide."
"According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in reverse, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to fight climate change.  Here is a link to the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center website: https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/co2/vostok.html"
"Eagerly issuing CO2 death threats to billions of innocent children is a Hitler level hate speech crime. 
You fear mongers don't love the planet, you just hate Humanity and most of all you hate yourselves and just want to drag the rest of us down with you in your miserably failed lives. #FU!"
"IF global warming was real???


Why did Hussein Obama just purchase a $15 MILLION home on Martha's Vineyard, an ISLAND???


Either Hussein Obama is even dumber than most people think he is.... OR


Hussein Obama well knows climate change is a complete HAOX!!!!!"
Climate change is a hoax and  a lie.
Obama is so concerned about rising sea levels he just bought a 15 million dollar Martha's Vineyard beachfront mansion.
let's do away with coca-cola because most people use plastic straws.                  ****
Cow farts and hamburger cause climate change.
Hey CNN let’s go after coco cola who is selling 1.9 billion serving of drink which is in Plastic in more than 200 countries per day too much plastic.
"Does CNN cover the elephant in the room, Chinese coal-fired power plants opening at an alarming rate?"
White people don't care about their crimes against the earth and or people of color.
"If we make it to point we have to worry about nutrition value, it will be a miracle. First will be massive crop failure."
CNN is fake news
He’s gotten his ass kicked by climate change.
Lol
"#WeAreWatching www.wearewatching.org

In early December 2019, Chile will host the 25th UN Climate Change Conference (COP25). In one sense, it's another conference at which the muckety-muck's of the world will meet for two weeks and talk, talk, talk, blah, blah, blah. If past is any prelude, another conference doesn't give much hope that something - ANYthing - will be done to actually address climate change. That's why Greta Thunberg and her movement have been so popular these days.

A friend of mine in Geneva, Switzerland is a social activist on many fronts and has launched a project to let the world leaders who will be in Chile that #WeAreWatching. The idea is for 77,000 people worldwide to post a picture of their faces (especially their eyes) which will be combined into a mosaic of an eye. This mosaic will be printed as a 10-story banner which will be hung from a building directly opposite the place where the world leaders will be meeting. We want to let them know that we don't want just talk, we want action, and We.Are.Watching.

The project and website (www.wearewatching.org) was launched on 19 September 2019 and will only last for a few weeks.

If you support Mother Earth and Greta and real action to combat climate change, please consider joining the project and sharing with your network."
"Climate Change... really?
Bogus!
We are not idiots!
We know about your agenda!

The New Green Deal will be destructive to our economy, and our way of life.

No more planes;
No more tourism;
No more diesel Trucks;
No more food deliveries;
No more trains;
No more traveling;
No more horses, they fart;
No more cows, they fart;
No more milk and cheese;
No more burgers;
No more electricity;
No more television;
No more drinking water;
No more toilets;
No more showers;
No more cooking;
No more restaurants;
Most of the above need fuel to operate, but creates Climate Change.
But there will be a lot of green grasses to eat, or not!"
"That is the most stupid point ever.  The cells are more robust and contain a lower concentration of metals.  Uhm, yes.  If I was 120lbs man than worked out for a year and drank protein shakes to gain 60 lbs of muscle mass and a little fat, the concentration of calcium and phosphorus in my body will be lower but the same in my blood.  Am I healthier at 180 or 120?  So dumb.  Soy is first an unnatural husbanded crop that in recent decades was further modified GMO anyway and has been spliced with the DNA of molds to produce antifungals and metabolize pesticides.  It's a frankenseed for Heaven's sake.  If the government would stop regulating the gene research we would already have homes that are planted that grow from genetically modified trees, heat and cool naturally, and clean our waste, need no maintenance, are earthquake-proof, fireproof, windproof, and sequester tons of CO2 per person.  This is stupid on so many levels."
Fight pollution so we can have cleaner air. Corn and soybeans are ruining people's health. Corn makes people fat.
doesnt mater acording to the bible this world is dun/over
Fake fabricated propaganda
CNN and climate change are FAKE NEWS
THEY fuck up everything THEY touch
Haha are you fat Liberal losers scared you’re gonna starve ????? Stop crying losers TRUMP   FOR LIFE!!!!!!!
Is climate change also responsible for the rampant mental illness amongst your followers?
So is fukishema.
"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2436/co2-is-making-earth-greenerfor-now/
so who are you going to believe?  CNN, purveyors of fake Russia Collusion hoaxes? Or NASA, those people that went to the moon and put that big space staion into orbit?"
And to think that these assholes that are part of the coverup probably go to church. Sickening.  How do you lie and be deceitful to fellow human beings about how to truly be healthy and in a natural way.  That is EVIL.  Talk about a disconnect.
Don’t the Democrats say that the world is overpopulated and that contributes to climate change?  But who encourages more children for the country to pay for so they get more votes.
What’s next is the water turning the frog gay
I love climate change!

"LOL, More fake news from the Commie News Network."
"Someone told Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon, Cuomo and Brian Stetler if they ate a lot of penis and shoved it in their asses it would prevent global warming which is why they do it so much."
FAKE NEWS!~ No such thing as global warming. CNN completely oblivious to scientific evidence there is no such thing.
"In 2022, soylent green will be available. So I an not worried. Just need to stash some ranch dressing."
"The Earth is Warming at an alarming rate, Global Warming is destroying our environment and hurting ourselves too. Only idiots don’t believe in scientists, that are saying this stuff. Earth maybe fine, but humans won’t.
